<h2>
CHAPTER I.
</h2>
<p>
The Ortl&rsquo;er is the Mont Blanc of the Tyrol, and seen from Nauders, a
village on a green, grassy table land, more than four thousand feet above
the sea, can well bear comparison with the boldest of the Swiss Alps.
Nauders itself, a type of a Tyroler village, is situated in a wild and
lonely region; it has all the picturesque elegance and neat detail of
which Tyrolers are so lavish in their houses, and, like every other Dorf
in this country, has its proud castle standing sentry over it. The Barons
of the Naudersberg were men of station in olden times, and exacted a
tribute over a tract extending deep into the Engadine; and now, in this
great hall, whose chimney would contain the heaviest diligence that ever
waddled over the Arlberg, a few Nauders notabilities are squabbling over
some mysterious passage in a despatch from Vienna, for it is the high
court of the district, while I wait patiently without for some formality
of my passport. To judge from their grave expressions and their anxious
glances towards me, one would say that I was some dangerous or suspected
personage&mdash;some one whose dark designs the government had already
fathomed, and were bent on thwarting. If they did but know how few are, in
all likelihood, the days I have yet to linger on, they would not rob me of
one hour of them in this wild mountain.
</p>
<p>
And yet I have learned something while I wait. This little dorf, Nauders,
is the birthplace of a very remarkable man, although one whose humble
name, Bartholomew Kleinhaus, is little known beyond Tyrol. Left an orphan
at five years old, he lost his sight in the small-pox, and was taken into
the house of a carpenter who compassionated his sad condition. Here he
endeavoured to learn something of his protector&rsquo;s trade; but soon
relinquishing the effort, he set to work, forming little images in wood,
at first from models, and then self-designed, till, at the age of
thirteen, he completed a crucifix of singular beauty and elegance.
</p>
<p>
Following up the inspiration, he now laboured assiduously at his new
craft, and made figures of various saints and holy personages, for his
mind was entirely imbued with a feeling of religious fervour; and to such
an extent that, in order to speak his devotion by another sense, he
actually learned to play the organ, and with such a proficiency, that he
performed the duties of organist for nearly a year in the village church
of Kaltenbrunnen. As sculptor, his repute is widely spread and great in
Tyrol. A St. Francis by his hand is at present in the Ambras collection at
Vienna; many of his statues adorn the episcopal palaces of Chur and
Brixen, and the various churches throughout the province.
</p>
<p>
Leaving the sculptor and his birthplace, which already a mountain mist is
shrouding, I hasten on, for my passport is at last discovered to be in
order, and I am free to pursue my road to Meran.
</p>
<p>
Of all spots in the Tyrol, none can compare with Merah, the wildest
character of mountain uniting with a profusion of all that vegetation can
bring. The snow peak, the glacier, the oak forest, the waving fields of
yellow corn, the valley, one vast vineyard&mdash;where have such elements
of grandeur and simple beauty in scenery been so gloriously commingled?
And then the little town itself&mdash;what a strange reminiscence of
long-buried years! The street&mdash;there is properly but one&mdash;with
its deep arched passages, within which the quaint old shops, without
windows, display their wares; and the courtyards, galleried around, story
above story, and covered at top by a great awning to keep off the sun; for
already Italy is near, and the odour of the magnolia and oleander is felt
from afar.
</p>
<p>
I wandered into one of these courts last night; the twilight was closing,
and there was a strange, mysterious effect in the dim distances upwards,
where figures came and went along the high-perched galleries. Beyond the
court lay a garden, covered over with a vine-roofed trellis, under whose
shade various tables were placed. A single light, here and there, shewed
where one or two guests were seated; but all so still and silently, that
one would have thought the place deserted. It seemed as if the great charm
was that mellow air softened by silence, for none spoke.
</p>
<p>
I walked for some time through the alleys, and at last sat down to rest
myself at a little table, over which a wide-leaved fig-tree spread its
dark canopy.
</p>
<p>
At first I did not remark that another person was seated near the table;
but as my eyes became more accustomed to the shade, I descried a figure
opposite to me, and immediately rising, I offered my apology in German for
intruding. He replied in French, by politely requesting I would be seated;
and the tone and manner of his words induced me to comply.
</p>
<p>
We soon fell into conversation; and although I could barely distinguish
his shadow as the night fell thicker, I recognised that he was an old man;
his accent proclaimed him to be French. We chatted away, the topics
ranging, with that wilfulness conversation always inclines to, from the
&ldquo;Wein-cur &ldquo;&mdash;the &ldquo;Grape cure&rdquo;&mdash;for which Meran is celebrated, to
the present condition and the past grandeur of the ancient town. With its
bygone history my companion seemed well acquainted, and narrated with
considerable skill some of its illustrious passages, concluding one by
saying, &ldquo;Here, in this very garden, on a summer morning of 1342, the
Emperor and the Margrave of Brandenburg sat at breakfast, when a herald
came to announce the advance of the procession with the future bride of
the Duke, Margaretta, while the Bishops of Augsburg and Regensberg, and
all the chivalry of the Tyrol, rode beside and around her. In yonder
little chapel, where a light now glitters over a shrine, was the betrothal
performed. From that day forth Tyrol was Austrian. Of all this gorgeous
festivity, nothing remains but an iron horse-shoe nailed to the chapel
door. The priest who performed the betrothal somewhat indiscreetly
suggested that, with such a dowry as the bridegroom received, he might
well be generous towards the Church; on which the Duke, a man of immense
personal strength, at once stooped down and wrenched a fore-shoe from the
bride&rsquo;s white palfrey, saying, with sarcastic bitterness, &lsquo;Here, I give
thee iron for stone!&rsquo; in allusion to the rocks and precipices of the Tyrol
land.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ungratefully spoken at the time,&rdquo; continued the stranger, &ldquo;and equally
false as a prophecy. These wild fastnesses have proved the best and last
defences of that same Austrian Empire. Indeed, so well aware was Napoleon
of the united strength and resources of the Tyrol, that one of his first
measures was to partition the country between Bavaria, Austria, and
Illyria. And yet this Tyrol loyalty is inexplicable. They are attached to
the house of Haps-burgh, but they are not Austrian in feeling. The friends
of free trade need not go far in Meran to find disciples to their
doctrine. Every one remembers the time that an aume of Meraner wine was
worth seventy-five gulden, which now is to be had for five; but then they
were Bavarian, and might barter the grape-juice for the yellow produce of
the Baierisch corn-fields. At the present day they are isolated, shut up,
and imprisoned by custom-houses and toll; and they are growing daily
poorer, and neglecting the only source they possessed of wealth.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
We talked of Hofer, and I perceived that my companion was strongly imbued
with an opinion, now very general in the Tyrol, that his merits were much
less than foreigners usually ascribe to him. Sprung from the people, the
host of a little wayside inn, a man with little education, and of the very
roughest manner, it is somewhat singular that his claims are most disputed
among the very class he came from. Had he been an aristocrat, in all
likelihood they had never ventured to canvass the merits they now so
mercilessly arraign. They judge of his efforts by the most unfair of tests
in such matters&mdash;the result. They say, &ldquo;To what end has Tyrol fought
and bled? Are we better, or richer, or freer than before?&rdquo; They even go
further, and accuse him of exciting the revolt as a means of escaping the
payment of his debts, which assuredly were considerable. What a terrible
price is paid for mob popularity, when the hour of its effervescence is
past!
</p>
<p>
We fell to chat over the character of revolutions generally, and the
almost invariable tendency to reaction that ensues in all popular
commotions. The character of the Three Days and the present condition of
France, more despotically governed than ever Napoleon dared, was too
palpable an example to escape mention. I had the less hesitation in
speaking my opinion on this subject, that I saw my companion&rsquo;s leanings
were evidently of the Legitimist stamp.
</p>
<p>
From the Revolution we diverged to the struggle itself of the Three Days;
and being tolerably familiar, from various personal narratives, with the
event, I ventured on expressing my concurrence with the opinion that a
mere mob, unprepared, unarmed, and undisciplined, could never have held
for an hour against the troops had there not been foul play.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where do you suspect this treachery to have existed?&rdquo; asked my companion.
</p>
<p>
The tone of the question, even more than its substance, confused me, for I
felt myself driven to a vague reply in explanation of a direct charge. I
answered, however, that the magnitude of the danger could scarcely have
been unknown to many men highly placed in the service of Charles X.; and
yet it was clear the King never rightly understood that any real peril
impended. The whole outbreak was treated as an &ldquo;échauffourée&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I can assure you of your error, so far,&rdquo; replied my companion. &ldquo;The
greatest difficulty we encountered&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; There was a slight pause
here, as if by use of the word &ldquo;we&rdquo; an unwitting betrayal had escaped him.
He speedily, however, resumed:&mdash;&ldquo;The greatest difficulty was to
persuade his Majesty that the entire affair was any thing but a street
brawl. He treated the accounts with an indifference bordering on contempt;
and at every fresh narrative of the repulse of the troops, he seemed to
feel that the lesson to be inflicted subsequently would be the most
efficacious check to popular excess in future. To give an instance,&mdash;a
very slight one, but not without its moral, of the state of feeling of the
court,&mdash;at four o&rsquo;clock of the afternoon of the third day, when the
troops had fallen back from the Place du Carrousel, and with great loss
been compelled to retreat towards the Champs Elysées, Captain Langlet, of
the 4th Lancers, volunteered to carry a verbal message to Versailles, in
doing which he should traverse a great part of Paris in the occupation of
the insurgents. The attempt was a bold and daring one, but it succeeded.
After innumerable hairbreadth dangers and escapes, he reached Versailles
at half-past seven. His horse had twice fallen, and his uniform was torn
by balls; and he entered the courtyard of the Palace just as his Majesty
learned that his dinner was served. Lang-let hastened up the great
staircase, and, by the most pressing entreaties to the officer in waiting,
obtained permission to wait there till the king should pass. He stood
there for nearly a quarter of an hour; it seemed an age to him, for though
faint, wounded, and weary, his thoughts were fixed on the scene of
struggle he had quitted, and the diminishing chances of success each
moment told. At last the door of a salon was flung wide, and the Grand
Maréchal, accompanied by the officers in waiting, were seen retiring in
measured steps before the King. His Majesty had not advanced half-way
along the corridor when he perceived the splashed and travel-stained
figure of the officer. &lsquo;Who is that?&rsquo; demanded he, in a tone of almost
asperity. The officer on guard stepped forward, and told who he was and
the object of his coming. The king spoke a few words hastily and passed
on. Langlet awaited in breathless eagerness to hear when he should have
his audience&mdash;he only craved time for a single sentence. What was the
reply he received?&mdash;an order to present himself, &lsquo;suitably dressed,&rsquo;
in the morning. Before that morning broke there was no King in France!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Take this&mdash;the story is true&mdash;as a specimen of the fatuity of
the Court. <i>Quem Deus vult perdere</i>;&mdash;so it is we speak of
events, but we forget ourselves.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But still,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the army scarcely performed their <i>devoir</i>&mdash;not,
at least, as French troops understand <i>devoir</i>&mdash;where their
hearts are engaged.&lsquo;&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are mistaken again,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Save in a few companies of the line,
never did troops behave better: four entire squadrons of one regiment were
cut to pieces at the end of the Rue Royale; two infantry regiments were
actually annihilated at the Hôtel de Ville. For eight hours, at the Place
du Carrousel, we had no ammunition, while the insurgents poured in a most
murderous fire: so was it along the Quai Voltaire.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have heard,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that the Duc de Raguse lost his head completely.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I can assure you, sir, they who say so calumniate him,&rdquo; was the calm
reply. &ldquo;Never before that day was a Marshal of France called upon to fight
an armed host, without soldiers and without ammunition.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;His fate would induce us to be superstitious, and believe in good luck.
Never was there a man more persecuted by ill fortune!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I perceive they are shutting the gates,&rdquo; said my companion, rising;
&ldquo;these worthy Meranersare of the very earliest to retire for the night.&rdquo;
 And so saying, and with a &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; so hastily uttered as to forbid
further converse, my companion withdrew, while I wandered slowly back to
my Inn, curious to learn who he might be, and if I should ever chance upon
him again.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
I heard a voice this morning on the bridge, so exactly like that of my
companion of last night, that I could not help starting. The speaker was a
very large and singularly handsome man, who, though far advanced in life,
walked with a stature as erect, and an air as assured, as he could have
worn in youth. Large bushy eye-brows, black as jet, although his hair was
perfectly white, shaded eyes of undimmed brilliancy&mdash;he was evidently
&ldquo;some one,&rdquo; the least observant could not pass him without this
conviction. I asked a stranger who he was, and received for answer,
&ldquo;Marshal Marmont&mdash;he comes here almost every autumn.&rdquo;

<h2>
CHAPTER II. THE TYROL
</h2>
<p>
Every traveller in the Tyrol must have remarked, that, wherever the way is
difficult of access, or dangerous to traverse, some little shrine or
statue is always to be seen, reminding him that a higher Power than his
own watches over his safety, and suggesting the fitness of an appeal to
Him who is &ldquo;A very present help in time of trouble.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Sometimes a rude painting upon a little board, nailed on a tree,
communicates the escape and gratitude of a traveller; sometimes a still
ruder fresco, on the very rock, tells where a wintry torrent had swept
away a whole family, and calling on all pious Christians who pass that way
to offer a prayer for the departed. There is an endless variety in these
little &ldquo;Votive Tablets,&rdquo; which are never more touching than when their
very rude poverty attests the simplest faith of a simple people. The
Tyrolers are indeed such. Perhaps alone, of all the accessible parts of
Europe, the Tyrol has preserved its primitive habits and tastes for
centuries unchanged. Here and there, throughout the continent, to be sure,
you will find some little &ldquo;Dorf,&rdquo; or village, whose old-world customs
stand out in contrast to its neighbours; and where in their houses, dress,
and bearing, the inhabitants seem unlike all else around them. Look more
closely, however, and you will see that, although the grandmother is
clothed in homespun, and wears her leathern pocket at her girdle, all
studded with copper nails, that her grandaughter affects a printed cotton
or a Swiss calico; and instead of the broad-brimmed and looped felt of the
old &ldquo;Bauer,&rdquo; the new generation sport broad-cloth and beaver.
</p>
<p>
Such hamlets are, therefore, only like the passengers left behind by their
own coach, and waiting for the next conveyance that passes to carry them
on their journey.
</p>
<p>
In the Tyrol, however, such evidences of progress&mdash;as it is the
fashion to call it&mdash;are rare. The peasantry seem content to live as
their fathers have done, and truly he must be sanguine who could hope to
better a condition, which, with so few prorations, comprises so many of
life&rsquo;s best and dearest blessings. If the mountain peaks be snow-clad,
even in midsummer, the valleys (at least all in South Tyrol) are rich in
vineyards and olive groves; and although wheat is seldom seen, the maize
grows every where; the rivers swarm with trout; and he must be a poor
marksman who cannot have venison for his dinner. The villages are large
and well built; the great wooden houses, with their wide projecting roofs
and endless galleries, are the very types of comfort. Vast piles of
fire-wood, for winter use, large granaries of forage for the cattle&mdash;the
cattle themselves with great silver bells hanging to their necks&mdash;all
bespeak an ease, if not an actual affluence, among the peasantry. The
Tyrolers are, in a word, all that poets and tourists say the Swiss are,
and of which they are exactly the reverse.
</p>
<p>
It would be difficult to find two nations so precisely alike in all
external circumstances, and so perfectly dissimilar in every feature of
character. Even in their religious feelings, Romanism, generally so
levelling, has not been able to make them of the same measure here. The
Swiss Catholic&mdash;bigotted, overbearing, and plotting&mdash;has nothing
in common with the simple-minded Tyroler, whose faith enters into all the
little incidents of his daily life, cheering, exalting, and sustaining,
but never suggesting a thought save of charity and good will to all.
</p>
<p>
That they have interwoven, so to say, their religious belief into all
their little worldly concerns, if not making their faith the rule, at
least establishing it as the companion of their conduct, is easily seen.
You never overtake a group, returning from fair or market, that all are
not engaged in prayer, repeating together some litany of the Church; and
as each new arrival joins the party, his voice chimes in, and swells the
solemn hum as naturally as if prearranged or practised.
</p>
<p>
If you pass a village, or a solitary farmhouse, at sunset, the same
accents meet your ears, or else you hear them singing some hymn in
concert. Few &ldquo;Bauer&rdquo; houses, of any pretension, are without the effigy of
a patron saint above the door, and even the humblest will have a verse of
a psalm, or a pious sentence, carved in the oaken beam. Their names are
taken from the saintly calendar, and every thing, to the minutest
particular, shews that their faith is an active working principle,
fashioning all their actions, and mingling with all their thoughts. Their
superstitions, like all simple-minded and secluded people&rsquo;s, are many;
their ignorance is not to be denied; mayhap the Church has fostered the
one, and done little to enlighten the other: still, if Romanism had no
heavier sin to account for, no darker score to clear up, than her dealings
in these mountains, there would be much to forgive in a creed that has
conferred so many good gifts, and sowed the seeds of so few bad ones.
</p>
<p>
These pious emblems find their way, too, into places where one would
scarce look for them&mdash;over the doors of village inns, and as signs to
little wine and beer-houses: and frequently the Holy personages are
associated with secular usages, strangely at variance with the saintly
character. Thus I have seen, in the village beside me, a venerable St.
Martin engaged in the extraordinary operation of shoeing a horse; though
what veterinary tastes the saint ever evinced, or why he is so
represented, I can find no one to inform me. On the summit of steep
passes, where it is usual, by a police regulation, to prescribe the use of
a drag to all wheel carriages, the board which sets forth the direction is
commonly ornamented by a St. Michael, very busily applying the drag to a
heavy waggon, while the driver thereof is on his knees hard by,
worshipping the saint, in evident delight at his dexterity. In the same
way many venerable and holy men are to be seen presiding over savoury hams
and goblets of foaming beer, and beaming with angelic beatitude at a party
of hard-drinking villagers in the distance. Our present business is,
however, less with the practice in general, than a particular instance,
which is to be met with in the Bavarian Tyrol, mid-way between the
villages of Murnou and Steingaden, where over the door of a solitary
little way-side inn hangs a representation of the Virgin, with a starling
perched upon her wrist. One has only to remark the expression of unnatural
intelligence in the bird&rsquo;s look, to be certain that it was not a mere
fancy of the artist to have placed her thus, but that some event of
village tradition, or history, is interwoven with her presence.
</p>
<p>
The motto contributes nothing to the explanation. It is merely a line from
the Church Litany, &ldquo;Maria, Mutter Grottes, hülf uns,&mdash;Mary, Mother of
God, help us!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
There is then a story connected with the painting, and we shall, with your
leave, tell it; calling our tale by the name of the little inn,
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;MARIA HULF!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Has our reader ever heard, or read, of those strange gatherings, which
take place at the early spring in the greater number of southern German
cities and are called, &ldquo;Year Markets?&rdquo; The object is simply to assemble
the youth of the mountain districts in Tyrol and Vorarlbreg, that they may
be hired, by the farmers of the rich pasture countries, as herds. Thither
they go&mdash;-many a mile&mdash;some children of ten or eleven years old,
and seeming even still younger, away from home and friends, little
adventurers on the bleak wide ocean of life, to sojourn among strangers in
far-off lands; to pass days long in lonely valleys or deep glens, without
a sight or sound of human life around them; watching the bright sun and
counting the weary minutes over, that night and rest may come, per* chance
with dreams of that far-off home, which, in all its poverty, is still
cheered by the fond familiar faces! Some, ruddy and stout-looking, seem to
relish the enterprise, and actually enjoy the career so promising in its
vicissitudes; others, sad and care-worn, bear with them the sorrows of
their last leave-taking, and are only comforted by the thought that autumn
will come at last, and then the cattle must be housed for the winter: and
then they shall be free to wend their way over mountain and plain, far,
far away beyond Maltz&mdash;high in the wild peaks of the Stelvio, or deep
in the lovely glens below Meran.
</p>
<p>
It was in one of these &ldquo;Markets&rdquo; at Inspruck that a little boy was seen,
not standing with the groups which usually gather together under a single
leader, but alone and apart, seemingly without one that knew him. His
appearance bespoke great poverty; his clothes, originally poor, were now
in rags; his little cap, of squirrel skin, hung in fragments on either
side of his pallid cheeks; his feet&mdash;a rare circumstance&mdash;were
bare, and bloodstained from travel; want and privation were stamped in
every feature: and his eyes, which at that moment were raised with eager
anxiety as some Bauer drew nigh, grew wan, and filling at each new
disappointment to his hopes, for this was his third day to stand in the
market, and not one had even asked his name. And yet he heard that name;
ever and anon it met his ears in sounds which stirred his feeble heart,
and made it throb faster. &ldquo;Fritzerl! ah, Fritzerl, good fellow!&rdquo; were the
words; and poor Fritzerl would stoop down when he heard them and peep into
a little cage where a Starling was perched&mdash;a poor, emaciated little
thing it was, as way-worn and poverty struck, to all seeming, as himself:
but he did not think so: he deemed it the very paragon of the feathered
tribe, for it had a little toppin of brown feathers on its head, and a
little ring of white around its neck, and would come when he called it;
and, better than all, could sing, &ldquo;Good Fritzerl&mdash;nice Fritzerl!&rdquo;
 when it was pleased, and &ldquo;Potztausend!&rdquo; when angry. This was all its
education; his master, poor little fellow, had not much more. How could
he? Fritzerl&rsquo;s mother died when he was a baby; his father was killed by a
fall from a cliff in the Tyrol Alps, for he was by trade a bird-catcher,
and came from the Engadine, where every one loves birds, and in the
pursuit of this passion met his fate.
</p>
<p>
Fritzerl was left an orphan at eleven years old, and all his worldly
wealth was this little Starling; for although his father had left a little
cabin in the high Alps, and a rifle, and some two or three articles of
house gear, they all were sold to pay the expenses of his funeral, and
feast the neighbours who were kind enough to follow him to the grave: so
that poor Fritz kept open house for two days; and when he walked out the
third, after the coffin, he never turned his steps back again, but
wandered away&mdash;far, far away&mdash;to seek in the year-market of
Inspruck some kind peasant who would take him home to herd his cattle, and
be a father to him now.
</p>
<p>
Fritzerl knew not that the children, who desire to be hired out, assemble
together in little groups or gangs, electing some one to bargain for them
with the Bauers, setting forth in vehement language their various
excellencies and good gifts, and telling where they have served before,
and what zeal and fidelity they have shewn to their trust. Fritz, I say,
knew not this; perhaps, if he had, it would have availed him but little;
for he was so poorly clad and so weak-looking, and so ignorant of all
about tending cattle besides, that he would soon have been driven from the
fraternity with disgrace. It was, then, as fortunate for him that he did
not know the custom of the craft, and that he took his stand alone and
apart beside the fountain in the main street of Inspruck.
</p>
<p>
And a lovely object is the same fountain; and a beautiful street it stands
in, with its stately houses, all rich in stuccoed arabesques, and
gorgeously carved doors and gates! And bright and cheerful, too, it looks,
with its Tyroler people clad in their gay colours and their gold-banded
hats!
</p>
<p>
Fritz saw little of these things, or, if he saw, he marked them not. Cold,
hunger, and desolation, had blunted the very faculties of his mind; and he
gazed at the moving crowd with a dreamy unconsciousness that what he saw
was real.
</p>
<p>
The third day of his painful watching was drawing to a close. Fritz had,
several hours before, shared his last morsel of black bread with his
companion; and the bird, as if sympathising with his sorrow, sat moody and
silent on his perch, nor even by a note or sound broke the stillness.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Poor Jacob!&rdquo;* said Fritz, with tears in his eyes, &ldquo;my hard luck should
not fall on thee! If no one comes to hire me before the shadow closes
across the street, I&rsquo;ll open the cage and let thee go!&rdquo;
 </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
* Every Starling in Germany is called Jacob.
</pre>
<p>
The very thought seemed an agony, for scarcely had he uttered it when his
heart felt as if it would break, and he burst into a torrent of tears.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Potztausend!&rdquo; screamed Jacob, alarmed at the unusual cries&mdash;&ldquo;Potztausend!&rdquo;
 And as Fritz sobbed louder, so were the Starling&rsquo;s cries of &ldquo;Potztausend!&rdquo;
 more shrill and piercing.
</p>
<p>
There were few people passing at the moment, but such as were, stopped;
some to gaze with interest on the poor little boy&mdash;more, far more, to
wonder at the bird; when suddenly a venerable old man, with a wide-leaved
bat, and a silken robe reaching down to his feet, crossed over towards the
fountain. It was the Curate of Lenz, a pious and good man, universally
respected in Inspruck.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What art thou weeping for, my child?&rdquo; said he, mildly.
</p>
<p>
Fritz raised his eyes, and the benevolent look of the old man streamed
through his heart like a flood of hope* It was not, however, till the
question had been repeated, that Fritz could summon presence of mind to
tell his sorrow and disappointment.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thou shouldst not have been here alone, my child,&rdquo; said the curate; &ldquo;thou
shouldst have been in the great market with the others. And now the time
is well-nigh over: most of the Bauers have quitted the town.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Potztausend!&rdquo; cried the bird, passionately.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It will be better for thee to return home again to thy parents,&rdquo; said the
old man, as he drew his little leathern purse from between the folds of
his robe&mdash;&ldquo;to thy father and mother.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have neither!&rdquo; sobbed Fritz.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Potztausend!&rdquo; screamed the Starling&mdash;&ldquo;Potztausend!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Poor little fellow! I would help thee more,&rdquo; said the kind old priest, as
he put six kreutzers into the child&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;but I am not rich either.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Potztausend!&rdquo; shrieked the bird, with a shrillness excited by Fritz&rsquo;s
emotion; and as he continued to sob, so did the Starling yell out his
exclamation till the very street rang with it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Farewell, child!&rdquo; said the priest, as Fritz kissed his hand for the
twentieth time; &ldquo;farewell, but let me not leave thee without a word of
counsel: thou shouldst never have taught thy bird that idle word. He that
was to be thy companion and thy friend, as it seems to me he is, should
have learned something that would lead thee to better thoughts. This would
bring thee better fortune, Fritz. Adieu! adieu!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Potztausend!&rdquo; said the Starling, but in a very low, faint voice, as if he
felt the rebuke; and well he might, for Fritz opened his little
handkerchief and spread it over the cage&mdash;a sign of displeasure,
which the bird understood well.
</p>
<p>
While Fritz was talking to the Curate, an old Bauer, poorly but cleanly
clad, had drawn nigh to listen. Mayhap he was not overmuch enlightened by
the Curate&rsquo;s words, for he certainly took a deep interest in the Starling;
and every time the creature screamed out its one expletive, he would laugh
to himself, and mutter,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thou art a droll beastie, sure enough!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He watched the bird till Fritz covered it up with his handkerchief, and
then was about to move away, when, for the first time, a thought of the
little boy crossed his mind. He turned abruptly round, and said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And thou, little fellow!&mdash;what art doing here?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Waiting,&rdquo; sighed Fritz, heavily&mdash;&ldquo;waiting!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, to sell thy bird?&rdquo; said the old man;&mdash;&ldquo;come, I&rsquo;ll buy him from
thee. He might easily meet a richer, but he&rsquo;ll not find a kinder master.
What wilt have?&mdash;twelve kreutzers, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I cannot sell him,&rdquo; sobbed Fritz; &ldquo;I have promised him never to do that.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Silly child!&rdquo; said the Bauer, laughing; &ldquo;thy bird cares little for all
thy promises: besides, he&rsquo;ll have a better life with me than thee.&rdquo; &ldquo;That
might he, easily!&rdquo; said Fritz: &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll not break my word.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what is this wonderful promise thou&rsquo;st made, my little man?&mdash;come,
tell it!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I told him,&rdquo; said Fritz, in a voice broken with agitation, &ldquo;that if the
shadow closed over the street down there before any one had hired me, that
I would open his cage and let him free; and look! it is nearly across now&mdash;there&rsquo;s
only one little glimpse of sunlight remaining!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Poor child! how many in this world live upon one single gleam of hope&mdash;ay,
and even cling to it when a mere twilight, fast fading before them!
</p>
<p>
The Bauer was silent for some minutes; his look wandered from the child to
the cage, and back again from the cage to the child. At last he stooped
down and peeped in at the bird, which, with a sense of being in disgrace,
sat with his head beneath his wing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come, my little man,&rdquo; said he, laying a hand on Fritz&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
take thee home with me! &lsquo;Tis true I have no cattle&mdash;nothing save a
few goats&mdash;but thou shalt herd these. Pack up thy bird, and let us
away, for we have a long journey before us, and must do part of it before
we sleep.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Fritz&rsquo;s heart bounded with joy and gratitude. It would have been, in good
truth, no very splendid prospect for any other to be a goatherd to a poor
Bauer&mdash;so poor that he had not even one cow; but little Fritz was an
orphan, without a home, a friend, or one to give him shelter for a single
night. It may be believed, then, that he felt overjoyed; and it was with a
light heart he trotted along beside the old Bauer, who never could hear
enough about the starling&mdash;where he came from? how he was caught? who
taught him to speak? what he liked best to feed upon? and a hundred other
questions, which, after all, should have been far more numerous ere Fritz
found it any fatigue to answer them. Not only did it give him pleasure to
speak of Jacob, but now he felt actually grateful to him, since, had the
old Bauer not taken a fancy to the bird, it was more than likely he had
never hired its master.
</p>
<p>
The Bauer told Fritz that the journey was a long one, and true enough. It
lay across the Zillerthal, where the garnets are found, and over the great
mountains that separate the Austrian from the Bavarian Tyrol&mdash;many a
long, weary mile&mdash;many, I say, because the Bauer had come up to
Inspruck to buy hemp for spinning when the evenings of winter are long and
dark, and poor people must do something to earn their bread. This load of
hemp was carried on a little wheeled cart, to which the old man himself
was harnessed, and in front of him his dog&mdash;a queer-looking team
would it appear to English eyes, but one meets them often enough here; and
as the fatigue is not great, and the peasants lighten the way by many a
merry song&mdash;as the Tyrol &ldquo;Jodeln&rdquo;&mdash;it never suggests the painful
idea of over-hard or distressing labour. Fritzerl soon took his place as a
leader beside the dog, and helped to pull the load; while the Starling&rsquo;s
cage was fastened on the sheltered side of the little cart, and there he
travelled quite safe and happy.
</p>
<p>
I never heard that Fritz was struck&mdash;as he might possibly, with
reason, have been&mdash;that, as he came into Bavaria, where the
wide-stretching plains teem with yellow corn and golden wheat, the
peasants seemed far poorer than among the wild mountains of his own Tyrol;
neither have I any recollection that he experienced that peculiar freedom
of respiration, that greater expansion of the chest, travellers so
frequently enumerate as among the sensations whenever they have passed
over the Austrian frontier, and breathed the air of liberty, so
bounteously diffused through the atmosphere of other lands. Fritz, I fear,
for the sake of his perceptive quickness, neither was alive to the fact
nor the fiction above quoted; nor did he take much more notice of the
features of the landscape, than to mark that the mountains were further
off and not so high as those among which he lived&mdash;two circumstances
which weighed heavily on his heart, for a Dutchman loves not water as well
as a Tyroler loves a mountain.
</p>
<p>
The impression he first received did not improve as he drew near the Dorf
where the old Bauer lived, The country was open and cultivated; but there
were few trees: and while one could not exactly call it flat, the surface
was merely a waving tract that never rose to the dignity of mountain. The
Bauer houses, too, unlike the great wooden edifices of the Southern Tyrol&mdash;where
three, ay, sometimes four, generations may be found dwelling under one
roof&mdash;were small, misshapen things, half stone, half wood. No deep
shadowing eave along them to relieve the heat of a summer sun;&mdash;no
trellised vines over the windows and the doorway;&mdash;no huge yellow
gourds drying on the long galleries, where bright geraniums and prickly
aloes stood in a row;&mdash;no Jâger either, in his green jacket and
gold-tas-selled hat, was there, sharing his breakfast with his dog; the
rich spoils of his day&rsquo;s sport strewed around his feet&mdash;the
smooth-skinned chamois, or the stag with gnarled horns, or the
gorgeously-feathered wild turkey, all so plentiful in the mountain
regions. No; here was a land of husbandmen, with ploughs, and harrows, and
deep-wheeled carts, driven along by poor-looking, ill-clad peasants, who
never sung as they went along, scarce greeted each other as they passed.
</p>
<p>
It was true, the great plains were covered with cattle, but to Fritz&rsquo;s
eyes the prospect had something mournful and sad. It was so still and
silent. The cows had no bells beneath their necks like those in the Alpine
regions; nor did the herds jodeln to each other, as the Tyrolers do, from
cliff to cliff, making the valleys ring to the merry sound. No, it was as
still as midnight; not even a bird was there to cheer the solitude with
his song.
</p>
<p>
If the aspect without had little to enliven Fritz&rsquo;s spirits, within doors
it had even less. The Bauer was very poor; his hut stood on a little knoll
outside the village, and on the edge of a long tract of unreclaimed land,
which once had borne forest-trees, but now was covered by a low scrub,
with here and there some huge trunk, too hard to split, or too rotten for
firewood. The hut had two rooms; but even that was enough, for there was
nobody to dwell in it but the Bauer, his wife, and a little daughter,
Gretchen, or, as they called her in the Dorf, &ldquo;Grettl&rsquo;a.&rdquo; She was a year
younger than Fritz, and a good-tempered little &ldquo;Mädle;&rdquo; and who, but for
over-hard work for one so young, might have been even handsome. Her eyes
were large and full, and her hair bright-coloured, and her skin clear; yet
scanty food and continual exposure to the air, herding the goats, had
given her a look of being much older than she really was, and imparted to
her features that expression of premature cunning which poverty so
invariably stamps upon childhood. It was a happy day for Grettl&rsquo;a that
brought Fritz to the cottage; not only because she gained a companion and
a playfellow, but that she needed no longer to herd the goats on the wild,
bleak plain, rising often ere day broke, and never returning till late in
the evening. Fritz would do all this now; and more, he would bring in the
firewood from the little dark wood-house, where she feared to venture
after nightfall; and he would draw water from the great deep well, so deep
that it seemed to penetrate to the very centre of the earth. He would run
errands, too, into the Dorf; and beetle the flax betimes;&mdash;in fact,
there was no saying what he would not do. Fritz did not disappoint any of
these sanguine expectations of his usefulness; nay, he exceeded them all,
shewing himself daily more devoted to the interests of his humble
protectors. It was never too early for him to rise from his bed&mdash;
never too late to sit up when any work was to be done; always willing to
oblige&mdash;ever ready to render any service in his power. Even the
Bauer&rsquo;s wife, a hard-natured, ill-thinking creature, in whom poverty had
heightened all the faults, nor taught one single lesson of kindliness to
others who were poor,&mdash;even she felt herself constrained to moderate
the rancour of her harshness, and would even at times vouchsafe a word or
a look of good humour to the little orphan boy. The Bauer himself, without
any great faults of character, had no sense of the fidelity of his little
follower. He thought that there was a compact between them, which, as each
fulfilled in his own way, there was no more to be said of it. Gretchen
more than made up for the coldness of her parents. The little maiden, who
knew by hard experience the severe lot to which Fritz was bound, she felt
her whole heart filled with gratitude and wonder towards him. Wonder,
indeed; for not alone did his services appear so well performed, but they
were so various and so numerous. He was every where and at every thing;
and it was like a proverb in the house&mdash; &ldquo;Fritz will do it.&rdquo; He found
time for all; he neglected&mdash;stay, I am wrong&mdash;poor little
fellow, he did neglect something&mdash;something that was more than all;
but it was not his fault. Fritz never entered the village church&mdash;he
never said a prayer; he knew nothing of the Power that had created him,
and all that he saw around him. If he thought on these things, it was with
the vague indecision of a mind without guidance or direction. Why, or how,
and to what end, he and others like him, lived or died, he could not, by
any effort, conceive. Fritz was a bondman&mdash;as much a slave as many
who are carried away in chains across the seas, and sold to strange
masters. There was no bodily cruelty in his servitude; he endured no
greater hardships than poverty entails on millions; his little sphere of
duties was not too much for his strength; his humble wants were met, but
the darkest element of slavery was there! The daily round of service over,
no thought was taken of that purer part which in the Peasant claims as
high a destiny as in the Prince. The Sunday saw him go forth with his
flock to the mountain like any other day; and though from some distant
hill he could hear the tolling bell that called the villagers to prayer,
he knew not what it meant. The better dresses and holiday attire suggested
some notion of a fete-day; but as he knew there were no fête-days for him,
he turned his thoughts away, lest he should grow unhappy.
</p>
<p>
If Fritz&rsquo;s companion, when within doors, was GrettFa, when he was away on
the plain, or among the furze hills, the Starling was ever with him.
Indeed he could easier have forgotten his little cap of squirrel-skin, as
he went forth in the morning, than the cage, which hung by a string on his
back. This be unfastened when he had led his goats into a favourable spot
for pasturage, and, sitting down beside it, would talk to the bird for
hours. It was a long time before he could succeed in obeying the Curate&rsquo;s
counsel, even in part, and teach the bird not to cry &ldquo;Potztausend!&rdquo;
 Starlings do not unlearn their bad habits much easier than men; and,
despite all Fritz&rsquo;s teaching, his pupil would burst out with the forbidden
expression on any sudden emergency of surprise; or sometimes as it
happened, when he had remained in a sulky fit for several days together
without uttering a note, he would reply to Fritz&rsquo;s caresses and entreaties
to eat by a sharp, angry &ldquo;Potztausend!&rdquo; that any one less deeply
interested than poor Fritz would have laughed at outright. They were no
laughing matters to him. He felt that the work of civilisation was all to
be done over again. But his patience was inexhaustible; and a
circumstance, perhaps, not less fortunate&mdash;he had abundant time at
his command. With these good aids he laboured on, now punishing, now
rewarding, ever inventing some new plan of correction, and at last&mdash;as
does every one who has that noble quality, perseverance&mdash;at last
succeeding,&mdash;not, indeed, all at once perfectly; for Star&rsquo;s
principles had been laid down to last, and he struggled hard not to
abandon them, and he persisted to cry &ldquo;Potz&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; for
three months after he had surrendered the concluding two syllables;
finally, however, he gave up even this; and no temptation of sudden noise,
no riotous conduct of the villagers after nightfall, no boiling over of
the great metal pot that held the household supper, nor any more alarming
ebullition of ill-temper of the good Fran herself, would elicit from him
the least approach to the forbidden phrase. While the Starling was thus
accomplishing one part of his education by unlearning, little Fritz
himself, under Grettl&rsquo;a&rsquo;s guidance, was learning to read. The labour was
not all to be encountered, for he already had made some little progress in
the art under his father&rsquo;s tuition. But the evening hours of winter,
wherein he received his lessons, were precisely those in which the poor
bird-catcher, weary and tired from a day spent in the mountains, would
fall fast asleep, only waking up at intervals to assist Fritz over a
difficulty, or say, &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; when his blunders had made him perfectly
unintelligible even to himself. It may be well imagined, then, that his
proficiency was not very great. Indeed, when first called upon by Grettl&rsquo;a
to display his knowledge, his mistakes were so many, and his miscallings
of words so irresistibly droll, that the little girl laughed outright;
and, to do Fritz justice, he joined in the mirth himself.
</p>
<p>
The same persistence of purpose that aided him while teaching his bird,
befriended him here. He laboured late and early, sometimes repeating to
himself by heart little portions of what he had read, to familiarise
himself with new words; sometimes wending his way along the plain, book in
hand; and then, when having mastered some fierce difficulty, he would turn
to his Starling to tell him of his victory, and promise, that when once he
knew how to read well, he would teach him something out of his book&mdash;&ldquo;Something
good;&rdquo; for, as the Curate said, &ldquo;that would bring luck.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
So long as the winter lasted, and the deep snow lay on the hills, Fritz
always herded his goats near the village, seeking out some sheltered spot
where the herbage was still green, or where the thin drift was easily
scraped away. In summer, however, the best pasturages lay further away
among the hills near Steingaden, a still and lonely tract, but
inexpressibly dear to poor Fritz, since there the wild flowers grew in
such abundance, and from thence he could see the high mountains above
Reute and Paterkirchen, lofty and snow-clad like the &ldquo;Jochs&rdquo; in his own
Tyrol land. There was another reason why he loved this spot. It was here
that, in a narrow glen, where two paths crossed, a little shrine stood,
with a painting of the Virgin enclosed within it&mdash;a very rude
performance, it is true; but how little connexion is there between the
excellence of art and the feelings excited in the humble breast of a poor
peasant child! The features, to his thinking, were beautiful; never had
eyes a look so full of compassion and of love. They seemed to greet him as
he came, and follow him as he lingered on his way homeward. Many an hour
did Fritz sit upon the little bench before the shrine, in unconscious
worship of that picture. Heaven knows what fancies he may have had of its
origin; it never occurred to him to think that human skill could have
achieved any thing so lovely.
</p>
<p>
He had often remarked that the villagers, as they passed, would kneel down
before it, and with bowed heads and crossed arms seem to do it reverence;
and he himself, when they were gone, would try to imitate their gestures,
some vague sentiment of worship struggling for utterance in his heart.
</p>
<p>
There was a little inscription in gilt letters beneath the picture; but
these he could not read, and would gaze at their cabalistic forms for
hours long, thinking how, if he could but decipher them, that the mystery
might be revealed.
</p>
<p>
How he longed for the winter to be over and the spring to come, that he
might lead the goats to the hills, and to the little glen of the shrine!
He could read now. The letters would be no longer a secret; they would
speak to him, and to his heart, like the voice of that beauteous image.
How ardently did he wish to be there! and how, when the first faint sun of
April sent its pale rays over the plain, and glittered with a sickly
delicacy on the lake, how joyous was his spirit and how light his step
upon the heather!
</p>
<p>
Many a little store of childish knowledge had Grettl&rsquo;a opened to his mind
in their winter evenings&rsquo; study; but somehow, he felt as if they were all
as nothing compared to what the golden letters would reveal. The portrait,
the lonely glen, the solemn reverence of the kneeling worshippers, had all
conspired to create for him a mass of emotions indescribably pleasurable
and thrilling. Who can say the secret of such imaginings, or bound their
sway?
</p>
<p>
The wished-for hour came, and it was alone and unseen that he stood before
the shrine and read the words, &ldquo;Maria, Mutter Gottes, hulf uns.&rdquo; If this
mystery were unrevealed to his senses, a feeling of dependent helplessness
was too familiar to his heart not to give the words a strong significance.
He was poor, unfriended, and an orphan: who could need succour more than
he did? Other children had lathers and mothers, who loved them and watched
over them; their little wants were cared for, their wishes often
gratified. His was an uncheered existence: who was there to &ldquo;<i>help him?</i>&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Against the daily load of his duties he was not conscious of needing aid;
his burden he was both able and willing to bear. It was against his
thoughts in the long hours of solitude&mdash;against the gloomy visions of
his own free-thinking spirit, he sought assistance; against the sad
influence of memory, that brought up his childhood before him, when he had
a father who loved him&mdash;against the dreary vista of an unloved
future, he needed help. &ldquo;And could <i>she</i> befriend him?&rdquo; was the
question he asked his heart.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He must ask Grettl&rsquo;a this; she would know it all!&rdquo; Such were the
reflections with which he bent his way homeward, as eagerly as in the
morning he had sought the glen. Grettl&rsquo;a did know it all, and more too,
for she had a prayer-book, and a catechism, and a hymn-book, though
hitherto these treasures had been unknown to Fritz, whose instructions
were always given in a well-thumbed little volume of fairy tales, where
&ldquo;Hans Däumling&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Nutz-cracker&rdquo; figured as heroes.
</p>
<p>
I am not able to say that Grettl&rsquo;a&rsquo;s religious instruction was of the most
enlightened nature&mdash;not any more than it was commensurate with the
wishes and requirements of him who sought it; it went, indeed, little
further than an explanation of the &ldquo;golden letters.&rdquo; Still, slight and
vague as it was, it comforted the poor heart it reached, as the most
straggling gleam of sunlight will cheer the dweller in some dark dungeon,
whose thoughts soar out upon its rays to the gorgeous luminary it flows
from. Whatever the substance of his knowledge, its immediate effect upon
his mind was to diffuse a hopeful trust and happiness through him he had
never known till now. His loneliness in the world was no longer the
solitary isolation of one bereft of friends. Not only with his own heart
could he commune now. He felt there was One above who read these thoughts,
and could turn them to his will. And in this trust his daily labour was
lightened, and his lot more happy.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; thought he, one day, as he wandered onward among the hills, &ldquo;now, I
can teach thee something good&mdash;something that will bring us luck.
Thou shalt learn the lesson of the golden letters, Starling&mdash;ay,
truly, it will be hard enough at first. It cost me many a weary hour to
learn to read, and thou hast only one little line to get off by heart&mdash;and
such a pretty line, too! Come, Jacob, let&rsquo;s begin at once.&rdquo; And, as he
spoke, he opened the cage and took out the bird, and patted his head
kindly and smoothed down his feathers. Little flatteries, that Starling
well understood were preparatory to some educational requirement; and he
puffed out his chest proudly, and advanced one leg with an air of
importance; and drawing up his head, seemed as though he could say, &ldquo;Well,
what now, Master Fritz?&mdash;what new scheme is this in thy wise head?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Fritz understood him well, or thought he did so, which in such cases comes
pretty much to the same thing; and so, without more ado, he opened his
explanation, which perhaps, after all, was meant equally for himself as
the Starling&mdash;at least I hope so, for I suspect he comprehended it
better.
</p>
<p>
He told him that for a long time his education had been grossly neglected;
that having originally been begun upon a wrong principle, the great
function of his teacher had been to eradicate the evil, and, so to say, to
clear the soil for the new and profitable seed. The ground, to carry out
the illustration, had now lain long enough in fallow&mdash;the time had
arrived to attend to its better culture.
</p>
<p>
It is more than probable Fritz had never heard of the great controversy in
France upon the system of what is called the &ldquo;Secondary Instruction,&rdquo; nor
troubled his head on the no less active schism in our own country between
the enemies and advocates of National Education. So that he has all the
merit, if it be one, of solving a very difficult problem for himself
without aid or guidance; for he resolved that a religious education should
precede all other.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now for it,&rdquo; said he, at the close of a longer exposition of his
intentions than was perhaps strictly necessary, &ldquo;now for it, Starling!
repeat after me&mdash;&lsquo;Maria, Mutter Gottes, hülf uns!&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The bird looked up in his face with an arch drollery that almost
disconcerted the teacher. If a look could speak, that look said, as
plainly as ever words could,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask me to say the whole Litany, Fritz?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; replied Fritz, for it was a reply, &ldquo;I know that&rsquo;s a great deal
to learn all at once, and some of the words are hard enough, too; but with
time, Star, time and patience&mdash;I had to use both one and the other
before I learned to read; and many a thing that looks difficult and
impossible even at first, seems quite easy afterwards. Come, then, just
try it: begin with the first word&mdash;&lsquo;Maria&rsquo;.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It was in vain Fritz spoke in his most coaxing accents, in vain did he
modulate the syllables in twenty different ways; all his entreaties and
petting», all his blandishments and caresses, were of no avail, Star
remained deaf to them all. He even turned his back at last, and seemed as
if no power on earth should make a Christian of him. Fritz had had too
much experience of the efficacy of perseverance in his own case to abandon
the game here; so he went to work again, and with the aid of a little lump
of sugar returned to the lecture.
</p>
<p>
Had Star been a Chancery lawyer he could not have received the fee more
naturally, though, for the honour of the equity bar, I would hope the
similitude ends there, for he paid not the slightest heed to the
&ldquo;instructions.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It would, perhaps, be rash in us &ldquo;featherless bipeds&rdquo; to condemn Star all
at once; there is no saying on what grounds he may have resisted this
educational attempt. How do we know that his reasoning ran not somewhat in
this strain?&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What better off shall I be when I have learned all your hard words?&mdash;or
how is it that you, my teacher, knowing them so well, should be the poor,
half-fed, half-naked thing I see there before me?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
These very conjectures would seem to have crossed Fritz&rsquo;s mind, for he
said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is not for a mere whim that I would have thee learn this; these words
will bring us luck, Star! Ay, what I say is true, though thou mayst shake
thy head and think otherwise. I tell thee, &lsquo;Good words bring luck.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Whether it was that Star assumed an air of more than ordinary conceit and
indifference, or that Fritz had come to the end of patience, I cannot
affirm; but he hastily added, and in a voice much louder and more excited
than was his wont,&mdash;&ldquo;It is so; and thou shalt learn the words whether
thou wilt or no&mdash;that I tell thee!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Potztausend!&rdquo; cried the bird, frightened by his excitement, and at once
recurring to his long unused exclamation: &ldquo;Potztausend!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Hush, shameless thing!&rdquo; said Fritz, angrily; &ldquo;there is nothing for it but
punishment!&rdquo; And so he replaced him in the cage, covered him close on
every side with his handkerchief, and trudged sorrowfully towards home.
</p>
<p>
For several days Fritz never spoke to Starling, even one word. He brought
him his food in silence; and instead of taking him, as of old, along with
him into the fields, he hung his cage in a gloomy corner of the hut,
whence he could see little or nothing of what went on in the house&mdash;no
small privation for a bird so alive to inquisitiveness. At length, when he
believed punishment had gone far enough, he took him down and hung him on
his back as usual, and brought him a long, long way into the hills. The
day was fine, a fresh but balmy spring breathed over the young flowers,
and the little stream danced and rippled pleasantly; and the clouds moved
along overhead in large soft masses, bordered with a silvery edge. Star
never noticed these things; he was indignant at the neglect, as he deemed
it, which had been shewn him of late. His pride and spirit&mdash;and
Starlings are not deficient in either&mdash;had sustained grievous injury;
and he felt that, without due reparation made to him, he could not,
consistently with honour, sign a treaty of reconciliation.
</p>
<p>
Fritz mistook these indications altogether&mdash;and who can blame him?
What the world calls dignity is not unfrequently mere sulk. How should
poor Fritz make distinctions great Ministers and Princes are sometimes
incapable of?
</p>
<p>
The end of all this was a struggle, a long and violent struggle, on each
side for the ascendancy. Fritz, however, had the advantage, for he could
starve out the enemy&mdash;a harsh measure, no doubt, but greater folks
have adopted even more severe ones to enforce their principles. Fritz,
besides, had all the stern enthusiasm of a fanatic in the cause. The dark
zeal of the Holy Office itself never enforced its decrees with more
inflexible purpose than did he his. &ldquo;Accept this creed, or die in your
sins,&rdquo; was, if not exactly his dictum, certainly his full meaning. Star
stood out long, so long that Fritz began at last to fear that the creature
meditated martyrdom, and in this dread he relaxed somewhat of his prison
discipline.
</p>
<p>
It would scarcely be instructive&mdash;not any more than amusing&mdash;to
recount the painful progress of this long contest&mdash;a contest, after
all, in which there is nothing new to any reader of history; for when
force is on one side and weakness on the other, the result may be deferred
but is never doubtful. It is enough that we say, Star made submission.
True, it was the submission of coercion&mdash;no matter for that, it was
submission; for after three weeks of various successes on either side, the
creature greeted Fritz one morning as he arose with a feint cry of &ldquo;Maria,
Maria!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This was enough, more than enough, and Fritzerl could have hugged him to
his heart.
</p>
<p>
His authority recognised, his will acknowledged, he was but too happy to
take his rebellious subject into full favour again. Whether Star felt the
benefits of his changed conduct so very satisfactory to his comfort, or
that he was really disposed to please his master, I cannot say; but, from
that hour out, he laboured strenuously to learn his new profession of
faith, and screamed &ldquo;Maria!&rdquo; from day-dawn to dusk. The two following
words were, however, downright puzzles; &ldquo;Mutter-Gottes&rdquo; was a combination
that no Starling&mdash;even a German one, bred up among strong gutturals
and flat labials&mdash;could master. He worked hard, however, and so did
Fritz. If life depended upon it, neither of them could have exerted
themselves more zealously; but it was no use. In any other language,
perhaps, Star might have been able to invoke the Virgin, but here it was
out of the question. The nearest approach the poor fellow could make was
something like a cry of &ldquo;Mörder&mdash;Mörder&rdquo; (Murder&mdash;murder); so
unfortunate a change that Fritz abandoned the lesson with the best grace
he could, betaking himself to the concluding words, which happily
presented no such unseemly similitudes.
</p>
<p>
His success here was such as to obliterate all memory of his former
defeat. Starling made the most astonishing progress, and learned the words
so perfectly, with such accuracy of enunciation, that to hear him at a
little distance any one would say it was some pious Catholic invoking the
Virgin with all his might. The &ldquo;Hülf uns&rdquo; was not a mere exclamation, but
a cry for actual aid, so natural as to be perfectly startling.
</p>
<p>
So long as the bird&rsquo;s education was incomplete, Fritzerl carefully
screened him from public observation. He had all the susceptibility of a
great artist, who would not let his canvass be looked upon before the last
finishing touch was laid on the picture. No sooner, however, had full
success crowned his teaching, than he proudly displayed him in a new cage
made for the occasion at the door of the Bauer&rsquo;s hut.
</p>
<p>
It was Sunday, and the villagers were on their way to mass; and what was
their astonishment to hear themselves exhorted as they passed by the
fervent cry of &ldquo;Maria, hülf uns! Hülf uns, Maria!&rdquo; Group after group stood
in mute amazement, gazing at the wonderful bird, some blessing themselves
with a pious fervour, others disposed to regard the sounds as miraculous,
and more than either stood in dumb astonishment at this new specimen of
ghostly counsel.
</p>
<p>
All this while Fritzerl lay hid beneath the window, enjoying his triumph
with a heart full almost to bursting. Never did singing-master listen to
the syren notes of his pupil, while as the <i>prima donna</i> of a great
opera she electrified or entranced a crowded audience, with more
enthusiastic rapture than did Fritz at his Starling&rsquo;s performance. Poor
little fellow! it was not merely vanity gratified by public applause&mdash;it
was a higher feeling was engaged here. A sense of religious exaltation
worked within him, that he had laboured in a great cause; a thrill of
ecstasy trembled at his heart that another voice than his own was asking
aid for him, and incessantly invoking the Virgin&rsquo;s protection on his own
head. Happy had it been for him that no other sentiment had intervened,
and that he had not also indulged a vain pride in the accomplishment of
his pupil!
</p>
<p>
It so chanced, that among those who passed the hut and stood to wonder at
this astonishing creature, was a tall, ragged-looking, swarthy fellow,
whose dress of untanned leather, and cap ornamented with the tail of many
a wood squirrel, told that he was an &ldquo;Engadiner,&rdquo; one from the same land
Fritz came himself. A strange wild land it is! where in dress, language,
custom, and mode of life, there is no resemblance to any thing to be seen
throughout Europe. A more striking representative of his strange country
need not have been wished for. His jacket was hung round with various
tufts of plumage and fur for making artificial birds, with whistles and
birdcalls to imitate every note that ever thrilled through a leafy grove;
his leathern breeches only reached to the knee, which was entirely bare,
as well as the leg, to below the calf, where a rude sandal was fastened;
his arms, also, copper-coloured as those of an Indian, were quite naked,
two leathern bracelets enclosing each wrist, in which some metal hooks
were inserted: by these he could hang on the branch of a tree, or the edge
of a rock, leafing his hands at liberty. He wore his coal-black hair fer
down on his back and shoulders, and his long moustache drooped deep
beneath his lank jaw. If there was something wild almost to ferocity in
his black and flashing eyes, the mouth, with its white and beautifully
regular teeth, had a look of almost womanly delicacy and softness,&mdash;a
character that was well suited to the musical sounds of his native
language ~one not less pleasant to the ear than Italian itself. Such was
he who stopped to listen to the bird, and who, stealing round to the end
of the hut, lay down beneath some scattered branches of firewood to
delight his ear to the uttermost.
</p>
<p>
It may be doubted whether a connoisseur ever listened to Orisi or Jenny
Lind with more heartfelt rapture than did the Engadiner to the Starling;
for while the bird, from time to time, would break forth with its newly
acquired invocation, the general tenor of its song was a self-taught
melody&mdash;one of those wild and delicious voluntaries in which
conscious power displayed itself; now, astounding the ear by efforts the
wildest and most capricious, now subduing the sense by notes plaintive
almost to bring tears. In these latter it was that he mingled his cry of
&ldquo;Maria, hülf&mdash;hülf&mdash;hülf uns, Maria!&rdquo;&mdash;words so touching
and so truthful in their accents that at every time the Engadiner beard
them he crossed himself twice on the forehead and the breast; which devout
exercise, I am constrained to say, had in his case more of habit than true
piety, as the sequel proved.
</p>
<p>
I forget whether it is not Madame de Seuderi has built a little theory
upon the supposition that every mind has within it the tendency to yield
to some one peculiar temptation. The majority, I fancy, have not limited
their weakness to units. Poverty has so many wants to be supplied, wealth
so many seductions to offer, that it may be affirmed he is not worse than
his fellows whose heart has only one undefended bastion. I am not anxious
to claim for my Engadiner any more than ordinary powers of resistance:
neither his race nor his country, the habits of his life, nor his
principles&mdash;if it be permitted to use the word&mdash;had taught him
such self-control; but, if they had&mdash;if they had steeled his nature
against every common seduction, they could not have stifled within him the
native passion for bird-catching, or, what is very much akin to it,
bird-stealing. He would as soon have thought it needful to restrict his
lungs in their requisite quantity of atmospheric air, as to curb what he
regarded as a mere human instinct. If Engadiners were made for any thing,
it was for bird-catching: no one did any thing else, thought, spoke, or
dreamt of any thing else, in the Engadine. It was not a pastime, or a
caprice; it was not that the one was skilful, or that the other was adroit
at it, but the whole population felt that birds were their natural prey,
and that the business of their life was comprised in catching, feeding,
training, sending, and selling them all over the globe&mdash;not only in
Europe, but over the vast continent of America. Wherever birds had
fanciers, wherever men cared for the tints of plumage or the warbling
mellowness of their notes, there an Engadiner was sure to be found. And
who has ever studied their nature like one of these mountaineers, who
knows all their habits and their tastes, their seasons of migrating and
returning, how they build their nests, and all their likings and their
antipathies&mdash;the causes which influence their selection and
abandonment of a peculiar locality, the meaning of their songs&mdash;ay,
and they are full of meaning&mdash;of welcome, of sorrow, of love, and of
despair? None like an Engadiner for all this! Few would have the patience,
fewer still the requisite gifts of acuteness, with uncommon powers of eye
and ear&mdash;of eye to discern the tints of plumage among the dark leaves
of the pine-forest&mdash;of ear to catch and imitate the notes of each
tribe, so that birds themselves should answer to the sounds.
</p>
<p>
The Engadiner stirred not from his hiding-place the whole day; he watched
the moving throng passing to and from the village church; he saw the
Bauers pass by, some in the Sunday &ldquo;waggons,&rdquo; their horses gaily
caparisoned, with huge scarlet tassels beneath their necks, and great wide
traces all studded with little copper nails; and the more humble, on foot,
the men dressed in their light Bavarian blue, and the women clad in a
coarser stuff of the same colour, their wealth being all centred in one
strange head-dress of gold and silver filigree, which, about the size and
shape of a peacock&rsquo;s tail when expanded, is attached to the back of the
head&mdash;an unwieldy contrivance, which has not the merit of
becomingness; it neither affords protection against sun or rain, and is so
inconvenient, that when two peasant women walk together they have to tack
and beat, like ships in a narrow channel; and not unfrequently, like such
craft, run foul of each other after all.
</p>
<p>
The Engadiner watched these evidences of affluence, such as his wild
mountains had nothing to compare with, and yet his heart coveted none of
them. They were objects of his wonder, but no more; while every desire was
excited to possess the little bird, whose cage hung scarcely three yards
from where he lay.
</p>
<p>
As evening drew nigh, the Engadiner became almost feverish in excitement:
each stir within the house made him fear that some one was coming to take
the bird away; every step that approached suggested the same dread. Twice
he resolved to tear himself from the spot, and pursue his journey; but
each time some liquid note, some thrilling cadence, fell like a charm upon
his ear, and he sank down spell-bound. He sat for a long time with eyes
rivetted on the cage, and then at length, stooping down, he took from the
ground beside him a long branch of pine-wood; he measured with his eye the
distance to the cage, and muttered to himself an assent. With a dexterity
and speed which in his countrymen are instincts, he fastened one handle of
his scissors to the branch, and tied a string to the other, making an
implement like that used by the grape-gatherers in the wine season. He
examined it carefully, to try its strength, and even experimented with it
on the jessamine that grew over the front of the cottage. His dark eyes
glistened like burning coals as the leaves and twigs were snapped off at a
touch. He looked around him to see that all was still, and no one near.
The moment was favourable: the Angelus was ringing from the little chapel,
and all the Dorf was kneeling in prayer. He hesitated no longer, but,
lifting the branch, he cut through three of the little bars in the cage;
they were dry and brittle, and yielded easily: in a moment more he had
removed them, leaving a little door wide enough for the bird to escape.
This done, he withdrew the stick, detached the scissors, and in its place
tied on a small lump of maple sugar&mdash;the food the bird loves best.
Starling, at first terrified by the intrusion, soon gained courage and
approached the bait. He knew not that a little noose of horse-hair hung
beneath it, which, no sooner had he tasted the sugar, than it was thrown
over his neck and drawn tight. Less practised fingers than the Engadiner&rsquo;s
could scarcely have enclosed that little throat sufficiently to prevent
even one cry, and yet not endanger life.
</p>
<p>
Every step of this process was far more rapid than we have been in telling
it. The moment it was effected, the Engadiner was away. No Indian ever
rose from his lair with more stealthy cunning, nor tracked his enemy with
a fleeter step: away over the wide plain, down through the winding glens,
among the oak-scrub, and into the dark pine-wood, who could trace his
wanderings?&mdash;who could overtake him now?
</p>
<p>
With all his speed, he had not gone above a mile from the Dorf when Fritz
missed his treasure. He went to take his bird into the house for the
night, when the whole misfortune broke full upon him, For a few seconds,
like most people under sudden bereavement, his mind could not take in all
the sorrow: he peered into the cage, he thrust his fingers into it, he
tumbled over the moss at the bottom of it; and then, at length, conscious
of nis loss, he covered his face with his hands, and sobbed as though his
heart was breaking.
</p>
<p>
Men and women may find it hard to sympathise with such sorrow. A child,
however, can understand a child&rsquo;s grief, for Fritz had lost every thing he
had in the world. This little bird was not only all his wealth, all his
ambition, his daily companion in solitary places, his hope, his friend,
but somehow it was linked mysteriously with the memories of his own home&mdash;memories
that every day, every hour, was effacing&mdash;but these, Star still could
call up in his heart: to lose him was, therefore, to cut the last slender
cord that tied him to the past and linked him to the future.
</p>
<p>
His violent sobbing brought Grettl&rsquo;a to him, but he could tell her nothing&mdash;he
could only point to the cage, which now hung on its side, and mutter the
one word,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Hin! hin!&rdquo;&mdash;Away! away!
</p>
<p>
The little girl&rsquo;s grief was scarcely less poignant than his own. She wrung
her hands in all the passion of sorrow, and cried bitterly.
</p>
<p>
The Bauer and his wife now came to the spot, the one to join in, the other
to rebuke, their afflictions. How little the children noticed either!
Their misery filled up every corner of their minds&mdash;their
wretchedness was overwhelming.
</p>
<p>
Every corner of the little hut was associated with some recollection of
the poor &ldquo;Star.&rdquo; Here, it was he used to feed&mdash;here, he hopped out to
greet Fritz of an evening, when the bad weather had prevented him
accompanying him to the fields. There, he was accustomed to sit while they
were at supper, singing his merry song; and here, would he remain silently
while they were at prayers, waiting for the moment of their rising to
utter the cry of &ldquo;Maria, hülf uns!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Each time the children&rsquo;s eyes met, as they turned away from looking at any
of these well-known spots, they burst into tears: each read the other&rsquo;s
thoughts, and felt his sorrows more deeply in the interchange.
</p>
<p>
What a long, long night was that! They cried themselves to sleep, to awake
again in tears!&mdash;now, to dream they heard &ldquo;Star&rdquo; calling to them&mdash;now,
to fancy he had come back again, all wayworn and ruffled, glad to seek his
usual shelter, and be with friends once more&mdash;and then they awoke to
feel the bitterness of disappointment, and know that he was gone!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And he told me, Grettl&rsquo;a&mdash;he told me &lsquo;A good word brings luck!&rsquo;&rdquo;
 sobbed Fritz, whose despair had turned to scepticism.
</p>
<p>
Poor Grettl&rsquo;a had no argument wherewith to meet this burst of misery&mdash;she
could but mingle her tears with his.
</p>
<p>
We frequently hear of the hard-heartedness of the poor&mdash;how steeled
they are against the finer affections and softer feelings of the world;
but it might be as well to ask if the daily business of life&mdash;which
to them is one of sheer necessity&mdash;does not combat more powerfully
against the indulgence of sorrow than all the philosophy that mere wisdom
ever taught?
</p>
<p>
Poor Fritzerl awoke with a heart almost weighed down with affliction, but
still he went forth with his goats to the pasture, and tended and watched
after them as carefully as ever. The next day, and the day after that
again, he went about his accustomed duties; but on the third day, as he
sat beside Grettl&rsquo;a under the old linden-tree before the door, he
whispered to her,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I can bear it no longer, Grettl&rsquo;a! I must away!&mdash;away!&rdquo; And he
pointed to the distance, which, vague and undefined as his own resolves,
stretched out its broad expanse before them.
</p>
<p>
Grettl&rsquo;a did her best to persuade him against his rash determination: she
reasoned as well as she could reason; she begged, she even cried to him;
and at last, all else failing, she forgot her pledge, and actually ran and
told her father.
</p>
<p>
The Bauer, sorry to lose so faithful a servant as Fritz, added his
influence to the little maiden&rsquo;s tears; and even the Bauer&rsquo;s wife tried to
argue him out of his resolve, mingling with her wise suggestions about a
&ldquo;wide world and a cold one&rdquo; some caustic hints about ingratitude to his
friends and protectors.
</p>
<p>
Fritz was deaf to all: if he could not yield to Grettl&rsquo;s prayers and
weeping eyes, he was strong against the old wife&rsquo;s sarcasms.
</p>
<p>
He cried all night through, and, arising before the dawn, he kissed
Grettl&rsquo;a as she lay sleeping, and, cautiously opening the latch, slipped
out unheard. A heavy dew was on the grass, and the large, massive clouds
rested on the mountains and filled the plain. It was cold, and gloomy, and
cheerless&mdash;-just such as the world is to the wanderer who,
friendless, alone, and poor, would tempt his fortunes in it!
</p>
<p>
Fritz wandered on over the plain&mdash;he had no choice of paths&mdash;he
had nothing to guide, no clue to lead him. He took this, because he had
often gone it with &ldquo;Star&rdquo; when he was happy and contented. As he went
along, the sun rose, and soon the whole scene changed from its leaden grey
to the bright tint of morning. The hoar-frost glittered like thousands of
spangles scattered over the grass; the earth sent up a delicious odour;
the leaves, as they opened, murmured softly in the air; and the little
brooks rustled among the stones, and rippled on with a sound like fairy
laughter. There was gladness and joy every where, save in that heart which
was now bereft of all.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What could he mean?&rdquo; said he, again and again to himself: &ldquo;&lsquo;A good word
brings luck!&rsquo; When had I ever misfortune till now?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Oh, Fritzerl! take care lest you are not making the common mistake, and
expecting the moral before the end of the story.
</p>
<p>
Were it my object to dwell on this part of my tale, I might tell you of
Fritz&rsquo;s long conflict with himself&mdash;his doubts, his hesitation, and
his reasonings, before he could decide on what course to take, or whither
to bend his steps. The world was a very wide one to hunt after a Starling
through it: that, he knew, though not very deeply skilled in geography.
</p>
<p>
Fritz had never heard of those wise inspirations by which knights-errant
of old guided their wanderings; nor, perhaps, if he bad, would he have
benefited by them, seeing that to throw the rein loose on his charger&rsquo;s
neck was a matter of some difficulty. He did, perhaps, what was the
nearest thing in practice to this: he wandered along, keeping the straight
path, and, neither turning right nor left, found himself at noon in the
opening of the beautiful glen that leads to Reute. He looked up, and there
were great mountains before him&mdash;not hills, but real mountains, with
pine-forests beneath, and crags above that, and over them, again,
snow-peaks and glaciers. They seemed quite near, but they were still many
a mile off. No matter: the sight of them cheered and encouraged him; they
reminded him of the old life among the Tyrol &ldquo;Jochs,&rdquo; and the wild cattle
sporting about, and the herdsmen springing from cliff to cliff, rifle in
hand. Ob, that was a free and joyous life!
</p>
<p>
Fritz&rsquo;s musings on this head were suddenly put a stop to by a severe pang
of hunger, in all likelihood suggested by the odour of a savoury mess
which steamed from the open window of a little hut on the road-side.
</p>
<p>
The peasant family were about to sit down to their twelve-o&rsquo;clock dinner,
when Fritz, unconsciously to himself, drew up at the window, and looked in
at the tempting food.
</p>
<p>
There is one custom in Germany, which, simple as it is, it would be hard
to praise above its merits: that is, the invariable habit of every one, so
far as his means permit, to help the foot-traveller on his journey. By an
old municipal law of most of the cities, the tradesmen cannot settle and
establish themselves in their native town till they have travelled and
lived in other places; thus learning, as it is supposed, whatever
improvements their several crafts may have obtained in different and
distant cities. These wanderings, which are usually for one year or two,
are accomplished during the period of apprenticeship; so that you never
travel on any of the high-roads without meeting these Lehr-Junkers, as
they are called, who, with a knapsack on their back, and a spare pair of
boots or two depending from it, are either smoking or singing to beguile
the way. As it is not to be supposed that they are over-abundantly
provided with means, it has grown into a recognised custom to assist them
with some trifle: but the good habit ends not here; it extends to the poor
boy returning from the gymnasium, or school, to see his parents&mdash;the
discharged or furloughed soldier&mdash;the wayfarer of every class, in
fact, whose condition pleads to those more plenteously endowed than
himself.
</p>
<p>
Fritz was now to reap the benefit of this graceful charity; and scarcely
had his wan features appeared at the window, than a sign from the chief
Bauer invited him to partake. Happily for poor Fritz&mdash;happily for all
who give and all who accept such aid&mdash;there is no sense of
humiliation in doing so. It is, in fact, less an alms-giving than a
remnant of the ancient hospitality which made the stranger welcome beneath
every roof&mdash;a custom that dates before rail-roads and giant hotels.
</p>
<p>
Fritz ate and drank, and was thankful. The few words he spoke were in
answer to the common questions, as to whence he came&mdash;and whither he
was going&mdash;and what was his handicraft; inquiries which puzzled him
sorely to reply to. His hesitations were not rendered more embarrassing by
the curiosity of his questioners; they neither cared to push him closely,
nor troubled their heads upon the matter.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Farewell,&rdquo; said the Bauer&rsquo;s wife, as he thanked her gratefully;
&ldquo;farewell. Be good and pious, young lad; don&rsquo;t keep naughty company, nor
learn bad ways; and remember &lsquo;A good word brings luck.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
His eyes filled up with tears as she spoke. Who can tell the conflict of
feelings they called up in his bosom?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where does this path lead to?&rdquo; he asked, in a faint voice*
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To Reute, child.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And then, after Rente?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To Zillerthal and Inspruck.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To Inspruck!&rdquo; said Fritz, while a sudden hope shot through him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go
to Inspruck,&rdquo; muttered he, lower. &ldquo;Good-by, Bauer; good-by, Frau. God
bless thee.&rdquo; And with these words he set out once more.
</p>
<p>
How little they who roll on their journey with all the speed and luxury
that wealth can purchase, defying climate and distance, know the
vicissitudes that fall to the lot of the weary foot-traveller! From city
to city, from kingdom to kingdom, the rich man glides on, the great
panorama of life revealing itself before him, without an effort on his
part. The Alps&mdash;the Pyrenees, scarcely retard him; the luxuries he
requires meet him at every halting-place, as though difference of region
should not trench upon even his daily habits; his patience, perhaps, not
more tried than by the occasional stoppages where fresh horses meet him.
And yet, between two such stations a foot-traveller may spend the
live-long day, wearied, footsore, heavy of heart. What crosses and trials
are his! What strange adventures, too! and what strange companionships!
Each day a new episode of life&mdash;but of life over which Poverty has
thrown its shadow.
</p>
<p>
Fritz was now to experience all this; now, travelling with a company of
wandering apprentices; now, keeping company with a group of peasants on
the way to market; sometimes, partaking of a seat in a Bauer&rsquo;s waggon&mdash;often,
alone and weary, thinking over his future&mdash;a future, that each day
seemed to render more doubtful and gloomy.
</p>
<p>
As he penetrated deeper into the Zillerthal, the journeys of each day
became longer, the resting-places for the night being further apart;
sometimes he was obliged to stop a day, or even two days, at a village, to
recruit strength sufficient for a long march; and then, he would have to
walk from before daylight to late in the night ere he reached his
destination. His was not strength to endure fatigue like this with
impunity; and if he did encounter it, it was from an enthusiasm that
supplied energy, where mere bodily strength had failed. Two hopes buoyed
him up, and carried him along through every opposing difficulty. Whether
Star had escaped by accident, or been taken away by design, he was lame,
and would surely be soon caught; and if so, what more likely than that he
would be sent to Inspruck to be sold, for there was the greatest
bird-market of all the world? at least so Fritz believed. His second
sustaining hope lay in the prospect of once again meeting the old Priest,
and learning from him how was it that a &ldquo;good word&rdquo; had not &ldquo;brought luck&rdquo;
 to him, and whether from any fault of his own.
</p>
<p>
These thoughts had so far obtained possession of his mind, that he became
almost unconscious of every other; from dwelling on them so much, and
revolving them so frequently and in so many different shapes and forms, he
grew to think that he had no other object and aim than to reach Inspruck
and solve these two doubts. Hunger, cold, and fatigue, every privation of
a long and weary journey, was unregarded by him; and although it was now
late in the autumn, and snow was beginning to fall on the mountain passes,
Fritz, poorly clad, and scarcely fed, trudged on, day after day, his own
heart supplying the courage which his weak frame denied.
</p>
<p>
As winter drew near the days grew shorter; and the atmosphere, loaded with
snow ready to drop, darkened the earth, and made night come on, as it
seemed, many hours before sunset. This left very little time to Fritz for
his long journeys, which, just at this very period, unfortunately, were
longer than ever. The way, too, had become far more dreary and deserted,
not only because it led through a little-travelled district, but that the
snow being too deep for wheeled carriages, and not hard enough for
sledges, the travellers were fain to wait till either rain or frost should
come on, to make the road practicable. Hence it happened, that not
unfrequently, now, Fritz journeyed the live-long day, from dawn to dark,
and scarcely met a single traveller, Sometimes, too, not a hut would be
seen in a whole day&rsquo;s march, and he would never taste a morsel of food
till he reached his halting-place for the night.
</p>
<p>
All this was bad enough, but it was not the only difficulty; the worst of
all was, how to find out the way in the mountain passes, where the snow
lay so deep, that the balustrades or parapets that flanked the road, and
often guarded it from a precipice, were now covered, and no wheel-track
could be seen to guide the traveller. Fritz, when he journeyed this road
before, remembered the awe and terror with which he used to peep over the
little stone railing, and look down hundreds of feet into the dark valley
beneath, where a great river was diminished to the size of a mere brawling
rivulet; and now, where was that parapet?&mdash;on which side of him did
it lie? A deep gorge was near&mdash;that he well knew; the unfrozen
torrent beneath roared like thunder, but a waving surface of untrodden
snow stretched away on either side of him, without foot-track or aught to
mark the way.
</p>
<p>
For a long time did the poor child stand uncertain which way to turn; now
thinking he heard the heavy plash of wheels moving through the snow, and
then discovering it was merely the sound of falling masses, which, from
time to time, slipped from their places, and glided down the steep
mountain sides» What desolate and heart-chilling solitude was there! A
leaden, greyish sky overhead&mdash;not a cloud, nor even a passing bird,
to break its dreary surface&mdash;beneath, nothing but snow; snow on the
wild fantastic mountain peaks; snow in waving sweeps between them. The
rocks, the fir-trees, all covered.
</p>
<p>
Fritz stood so long, that already the thin drift settled on his head and
shoulders, and clothed him in the same wintry livery as the objects
around; his limbs were stiff, his fingers knotted and frozen; the little
tears upon his blue cheeks seemed almost to freeze; his heart, that till
now bore bravely up, grew colder and heavier. He felt as if he would be
happy if he could cry, but that even grief was freezing within him.
Despair was near him then! He felt a drowsy confusion creeping over him.
Clouds of white snow-drift seemed to fall so thickly around, that every
object was hidden from view. Crashing branches and roaring torrents
mingled their noises with the thundering plash of falling snow-masses. Oh!
if he could but sleep, and neither hear nor see these wearying sounds and
sights&mdash;sleep, and be at rest! It was just at this instant his eye
caught sight of a little finger-post, from which a passing gust of wind
had carried away the snow. It stood at some distance beneath him, in the
midst of a waving field of snow. Had poor Fritz remarked its leaning
attitude, and the depth to which it was covered, scarcely more than three
feet appearing above the surface, he would have known it must have been
carried away from its own appointed spot; but his senses were not clear
enough for such simple reasonings, and with a last effort he struggled
towards it. The snow grew deeper at every step; not only did it rise above
his foot, and half his leg, but it seemed to move in a great mass all
around him, as if a huge fragment of the mountain had separated, and was
floating downwards. The post, too, he came not nearer to it; it receded as
he advanced;&mdash;was this a mere delusion? had his weakened faculties
lost all control of sense? Alas! these sensations were but too real! He
had already crossed the parapet which flanked the road&mdash;already was
he in the midst of a great &ldquo;wraith&rdquo; of fallen snow, which, descending from
the mountain peak, by a storm in the night, had carried away the
finger-post, and now only waited the slightest impulse&mdash;the weight of
that little child&mdash;to carry it down, down into the depth below! And
down, indeed, it went; at first, slowly&mdash;moving like a great unbroken
wave; then growing more hurried as it neared the edge of the precipice,
thickening and swelling with fresh masses: it rose around him&mdash;now,
circling his waist, now, enclosing his shoulders: he had but time to grasp
the little wooden cross, the emblem of hope and succour, when the mass
glided over the brink, and fell thundering into the dark abyss.
</p>
<p>
I would not risk any little credit I may, perchance, possess with the
reader, by saying how deep that gorge actually was; but this will I say,
when standing on the spot, in a very different season from this I have
described&mdash;when the trees were in full leaf, the wild flowers
blossoming, and both sky above and river beneath, blue as the bluest
turquoise; yet even then, to look down the low parapet into the narrow
chasm, was something to make the head reel and the heart&rsquo;s blood chill.
</p>
<p>
But to my story.&mdash;It was the custom in this season, when the snow
fell heavily on the high passes, to transmit the little weekly mail
between Reute and Inspruck by an old and now disused road, which led along
the edge of the river, and generally, from its sheltered situation,
continued practicable and free from snow some weeks later than the
mountain road. It was scarce worthy to be called a road&mdash;a mere
wheel-track, obstructed here and there by stones and masses of rock that
every storm brought down, and not unfrequently threatened, by the flooding
of the river, to be washed away altogether.
</p>
<p>
Along this dreary way the old postilion was wending&mdash;now, pulling up
to listen to the crashing thunders of the snow, which, falling several
hundred feet above, might at any moment descend and engulf him&mdash;again,
plying his whip vigorously, to push through the gorge, secretly vowing in
his heart that, come what would, he would venture no more there that year.
Just as he turned a sharp angle of the rock, where merely space lay for
the road between it and the river, he found his advance barred up by a
larch-tree, which, with an immense fragment of snow, had fallen from
above. Such obstacles were not new to him, and he lost no time in
unharnessing his horse and attaching him to the tree. In a few minutes the
road was cleared of this difficulty; and he now advanced, shovel in hand,
to make a passage through the snow.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Saperlote!&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;here is the finger-post! This must have come down
from the upper road.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Scarcely were the words uttered, when a cry of horror broke from him. He
trembled from head to foot; his eyes seemed bursting from their sockets:
and well might they, for, close around the wood, just where it emerged
from the snow, were two little hands clasped tightly round the timber.
</p>
<p>
He threw himself on the spot, and tore up the snow with his fingers. An
arm appeared, and then the long yellow hair of a head resting on it.
Working with all the eagerness of a warm and benevolent nature, he soon
disinterred the little body, which, save one deep cut upon the forehead,
seemed to have no other mark of injury; but it lay cold and motionless&mdash;no
sign of life remaining.
</p>
<p>
He pressed the little flask of brandy&mdash;all that he possessed&mdash;against
the wan, white lips of the child; but the liquor ran down the chin and
over the cheek&mdash;not a drop of it was sucked. He rubbed the hands, he
chafed the body, he even shook it; but, heavy and inert, it gave no sign
of life.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ach, Gott!&rdquo; muttered he, &ldquo;it is all over!&rdquo; But still, with a hope that
asked no aid from reason, he wrapped the child&rsquo;s body in his fur mantle,
and, laying him softly down in the cart, continued his way.
</p>
<p>
The lights, which were glittering here and there through the little
village inns, had been gradually extinguished as the night grew later,
till, at last» none remained, save those around the door of the
post-house, where a little group of loungers was gathered, As they talked
together, one or other occasionally would step out into the road and seem
to listen, and then rejoin his companions. &ldquo;No sign of him yet! What can
keep him so late as this?&rdquo; cried the Post-master, holding up his watch,
that the lamp-light should fall on it. &ldquo;It wants but four minutes to
eleven&mdash;his time, by right, is half after nine.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He is trying the upper road belike, and the deep snow has detained him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;Old Cristoph&rsquo;s too knowing for that: bad as the
lower road is, the upper is worse; and with the storm of last night, there
will be drift there deep enough to swallow horse and mail-cart twice
over.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There may be fallen snow on the lower road,&rdquo; whispered a third; &ldquo;Cristoph
told me last week he feared it would not be safe for another journey.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a daring old fellow,&rdquo; said the Post-master, as he resumed his walk
up and down to keep his feet warm; &ldquo;but he&rsquo;ll try that lower road once too
often. He can&rsquo;t bear the upper road because it is a new one, and was not
made when he was a boy. He thinks that the world is not half so wise, or
so good, as it was some fifty years back.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If he make no greater mistakes than that,&rdquo; muttered an old white-headed
hostler, &ldquo;he may be trusted to choose his own road.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that Philip is mumbling?&rdquo; said the Post-master; but a general cry
of &ldquo;Here he comes! Here he is now!&rdquo; interrupted the answer.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;See how he drives full speed over the bridge!&rdquo; exclaimed the Post-master,
angrily. &ldquo;Potz-Teufel! if the Burgomaster hears it, I shall have to pay a
fine of four gulden; and I would not wonder if the noise awoke him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
There was less exaggeration than might be supposed in this speech, for Old
Cristoph, in open defiance of all German law, which requires that nothing
faster than a slow walk should be used in crossing a wooden bridge,
galloped at the full stride of his beast, making every crazy plank and
timber tremble and vibrate with a crash like small arms.
</p>
<p>
Never relaxing in his speed, the old man drove at his fastest pace through
the narrow old Roman gate, up the little paved hill, round the sharp
corner, across the Platz, into the main street, and never slackened till
he pulled up with a jerk at the door of the post-house: when, springing
from his seat, he detached the lamp from its place, and thrust it into the
waggon, crying with a voice that excitement had elevated into a scream,&mdash;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s
alive still!&mdash;I&rsquo;ll swear I heard him sigh! I know he&rsquo;s alive!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It is hard to say what strange conjectures might have been formed of the
old man&rsquo;s sanity, had he not backed his words by stooping down and lifting
from the straw, at the bottom of the cart, the seemingly dead body of a
boy, which, with the alacrity of one far younger, he carried up the steps,
down the long arched passage, and into the kitchen, where he laid him down
before the fire.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Quick now, Ernest; run for the doctor! Away, Johan; bring the Staats
Physicus&mdash;bring two&mdash;all of them in the town! Frau Hostess, warm
water and salt&mdash;salt, to rub him with&mdash;I know he is alive!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A shake of the head from the old hostess seemed to offer a strong dissent.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Never mind that! He is not dead, though he did fall from the Riesenfels.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;From the Riesenfels!&rdquo; exclaimed three or four together in amazement.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who was it came galloping at full speed over the Bridge, and passed the
grand guard on the Platz at the same disorderly pace?&rdquo; said the deep voice
of the Burger-meister, who arose from his bed to learn the cause of the
tumult.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was I,&rdquo; exclaimed Cristoph, ruggedly; &ldquo;there lies the reason.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The penalty is all the same,&rdquo; growled the man of authority: &ldquo;four gulden
for one, and two gulden thirty kreutzers for the other offence.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Cristoph either did not hear or heed the speech.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the mail-bag? I haven&rsquo;t seen that yet,&rdquo; chimed in the
Post-master; who, like a wise official, followed the lead of the highest
village functionary.
</p>
<p>
Old Cristoph bustled out, and soon returned, not only with the leathern
sack in question, but with a huge fragment of a wooden cross over his
shoulders.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the bag, Herr Post-meister, all safe and dry,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and here
Herr Burger-meister, here&rsquo;s your fine finger-post that the Governor
ordered to be stuck up on the Riesenfels. I suppose they&rsquo;ll need it again
when the snow melts and the road is clear: though to be sure,&rdquo; added he,
in a lower tone, &ldquo;he must have worse eyes than Old Cristoph who could not
see his way to Imst from that cliff without a finger-post to guide him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The Burgermeister was not disposed to suffer this irony in silence; but
the occasion to exert his authority with due severity was not at that
moment, when the whole attention of the bystanders was directed to the
proceedings of the three village doctors&mdash;one of them no less a
personage than the Staats Physicus&mdash;who, with various hard terms of
art, were discussing the condition of the senseless form before them.
</p>
<p>
Were I to recount one half of the learned surmises and deep
prognostications of these wise Esculapians, the chances are, my reader
would grow as weary of the recital as did poor old Cristoph of the
reality. For at last, unable to endure any longer active controversies
about the pia mater and the dura mater, the vitreous table and the
cerebellum, with vague hints of &ldquo;congestion,&rdquo; &ldquo;depression,&rdquo; &ldquo;effusion,&rdquo;
 and so on, he broke in with, &ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name, dear gentlemen, let him be
kept warm and have a good glass of &lsquo;schnaps&rsquo; down his poor throat; and
when he shews a chance of living, fight away about the name of the malady
to your hearts&rsquo; content.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I am far from defending, Old Cristoph&rsquo;s rude interruption. The learned
faculties should always be treated with becoming deference; but he was a
rude, unpolished old fellow, and the best one can say is, that he meant it
well. Certain it is they seemed to acknowledge the force of his
suggestion; for they at once removed the child to a warm bed, while they
ordered the hostess to administer a very comfortable cordial of her own
devising; and, to shew their confidence in the remedy, had three likewise
provided for their own individual comfort and support.
</p>
<p>
It is not my wish to dwell on the sad portions of our tale, wherever the
recital would elicit nothing of our little hero&rsquo;s character: and such was
the period which now ensued. Fritz was conveyed, early on the following
morning, to the village hospital, where his case was pronounced of the
very gravest nature. The dangers from cold, inanition, and exposure, were
all inferior to the greater one resulting from some injury to the brain. I
cannot be expected to be clearer and more explicit on this theme than were
his doctors; and they, with proverbial propriety, did differ most
amazingly: one advocating a fracture, another a concussion, and a third
standing out for both, and something more. They agreed, however, on two
points; one of which was, that he would die&mdash;and the other, that as
he was evidently very poor and had no friends, his death was of less
consequence. I would not be here understood, by any malevolent critic, as
wishing to infer that the doctors&rsquo; neglect of him was a strong point in
Fritz&rsquo;s favour. I merely desire to relate a simple fact&mdash;that he
continued to live from day to day, and from week to week, gaining in
strength, but never once evidencing, by even the slightest trait, a return
to his faculty of reasoning. Alas, poor child!&mdash;the intellect which,
in all his sorrow and poverty, had been his happiness and his comfort, was
now darkened, and he awoke from that long dream of death&mdash;an idiot!
</p>
<p>
Perhaps I may not have used the fitting word; but how shall I speak of his
state? He seemed sad and sorrow-struck; never spoke, even to answer a
question; moved listlessly and slowly about, as if in search of something,
and muttering lowly to himself. No one ever saw him smile, and yet he did
not weep. He looked more like one in whom reason was, by some terrible
shock, suspended and held in abeyance, than actually routed or
annihilated. Unlike most others similarly afflicted, he slept very little,
remaining usually, the night long, sitting beside his bed, gesticulating
with his hands in a strange way, and suddenly ceasing if observed.
</p>
<p>
His eye, for some minutes, would often seem bright with intelligence; but
on looking more closely, it would be discovered that the gaze was fixed on
vacancy, and it might be conjectured that no image of any near object was
presented to the mind, since no expression of pain, pleasure, or
astonishment would follow, when different substances were displayed before
him. One might say, that the faculties were entirely absorbed by their own
operations, and neither took note of those recorded by the senses, nor had
any sympathy with their workings&mdash;volition wad at a stand-still. But
why dwell on so sorrowful a picture?
</p>
<p>
Spring came, and Fritz, who ever obeyed each command of those over him,
was suffered to walk daily in the little garden of the asylum. One day&mdash;it
was the first bright one of the new season&mdash;the birds were singing
sweetly in the trees when he went forth, and they who came some time after
to fetch him to the house, found him in tears. His sorrow seemed, however,
to have brought some sense of relief with it, for that night he slept more
calmly and longer than usual. From this time out it was remarked that his
appearance varied with the weather of each day. When the air was clear,
and the sun shone bright, and the birds gathered together in the
blossoming branches of the fruit-trees, he seemed happier; but when dark
skies or rain came on, he would walk impatiently from place to place&mdash;now,
as if in search of some missing object&mdash;now, as if suddenly
overwhelmed by his loss.
</p>
<p>
Thus did he continue till about the first week in May, when at the usual
hour of recalling him to the house he was not to be found. Search was made
every where&mdash;through the garden&mdash;about the neighbouring
buildings&mdash;in all the Dorf&mdash;but all in vain. No one had seen
him.
</p>
<p>
Poor and unfriended as he was, his little simple ways, his sinless
innocence and gentleness, had made him friends among all who had any
authority in the asylum; and no pains were spared to track him out and
discover him&mdash;to no end, however. He was seen there no more. Days and
weeks long, with unwearying zeal, the search continued, and was only
abandoned when all hope seemed gone. By none was this sad termination of
his suffering more poignantly felt than by old Cristoph. Every week he
came to Imst, his first care was to ask after the little boy; and when he
learned his fate, his grief was deep and heartfelt.
</p>
<p>
I know not if my reader has ever visited Inspruck.
</p>
<p>
Every one has been every where nowadays; and so the chances are, that the
Tyrol capital is as well known to them as to myself. At all the hazard of
being tedious, however, I must mention one feature of that beautiful old
city&mdash;a little street which leads out of the Old Market, and runs
westward down a somewhat steep declivity towards the Inn. It is one of
those narrow, old, gloomy alleys a traveller would scarcely think of
exploring. A low range of arches, supported on pillars of the most sturdy
proportions, runs along either side, furnished with massive stone seats,
worn smooth by the use of some centuries of gossips. The little shops
within this dark arcade are undefended by windows of any kind, but lie
open, displaying to the passer-by, not only the various wares exposed for
sale, but frequently, as the wind, or chance, waves the folds of an old
curtain at the back, the little household of the merchant himself.
</p>
<p>
The middle portion of this street, scarcely wide enough for three to walk
abreast, grows even narrower as you look up, by the gradual encroachment
of each story on either side; so that while the denizens of the
first-floors have merely the neighbourly advantages of a near salutation,
they who inhabit the garrets may embrace without any fear on the score of
bodily danger. Our business is only with those beneath, however, and
thither I must ask of your accompanying me.
</p>
<p>
If the two groined arches&mdash;dark with age as well as feint light&mdash;the
narrow gloomy-looking alley, might at first deter the stranger from
entering, scarcely would he venture a few steps ere a strange fascination
would lead him onward. Within these little dens&mdash;for such rather than
shops do they seem&mdash;are objects to be found, the strangest and the
most curious ever exposed for sale. In one, you find a collection of
ancient armour the greatest Ritter Saal would be proud to choose from:&mdash;weapons
of every age and country&mdash;the chain-mail of Milan&mdash;the
plate-armour of Venice&mdash;the heavy double-nailed suits of Regens-bourg&mdash;the
small conical helmet of the East&mdash;the massive but beautifully
fashioned casque of Spanish mould&mdash;the blade of Damascus&mdash;the
double-handled sword of Appenzell&mdash;the jereed&mdash;the Crusader&rsquo;s
lance&mdash;the old pike of the Tyrol, with daggers and poniards of every
shape, that luxury or cruelty ever invented. Adjoining this, perhaps,
lives one who deals in rare flowers and shrubs; and, strange as it may
seem in such a place, the orange-tree, the cactus, the camellia, and the
aloe, shed their bloom and perfume through these vaulted cells, where age,
and rust, and decay would appear the most fitting denizens. Here, lives
one who sells the rich brocaded silks and tabourets of a by-gone century&mdash;great
flowering waistcoats, stiff and imposing as the once wearers&mdash;huge
sweeping trains of costly embroidery&mdash;relics of a time when
stateliness was cultivated, and dignified deportment the distinctive sign
of birth. Right opposite to this is a store of ancient articles of
furniture and <i>virtù</i>&mdash;marquetry and buhl&mdash;Dresden and
Sèvres&mdash;carved oak and ebony&mdash;ivory and box-wood. All that ever
fancy conceived uncomfortable to sit upon, or a diseased imagination ever
inaugurated as the throne of nightmare to sleep in&mdash;are here to be
had. Stools to kneel upon and altars to kneel at&mdash;Virgins in ivory
and silver&mdash;idols of Indian adoration&mdash;ancient goblets, and most
curiously carved treasure-boxes of solid iron, massive little emblems of a
time when men put slight faith in bankers.
</p>
<p>
A little further on you may meet with a jeweller&rsquo;s, where ornaments the
most rare and costly are to be found: massive old necklaces of amethyst or
emerald, in which the ungainly setting bears such a contrast to the value
of the stone&mdash;rich clasps of pink topaz or ruby, for the collar of a
cloak&mdash;sword-handles all paved with precious gems&mdash;and
signet-rings, that have circled the fingers of proud Counts of the Empire,
and, mayhap, sealed with their impress many a dark and gloomy record.
</p>
<p>
Some deal in old books and manuscripts, ancient rolls, and painted
missals; some, in curious relics of horse-equipment, brass-mounted
demi-piques and iron-strapped saddles of the sixteenth century, with spurs
of a foot in length, and uncouth bits that would hold an elephant in
check: and one little dusky corner-shop, kept by an old hunchback,
contained the strangest of all stocks-in-trade,&mdash;an assemblage of
instruments of torture: chains of every kind hung from the ceiling;
thumb-screws, back-bolts, helmets made to close upon the skull, and
crushed by the action of a vice; racks, hatchets, and pincers; while
conspicuous in the midst, as the support of an old iron lantern, is the
block of a headsman, the surface bearing the shocking record of its usage.
Just where this grim and ghastly cell stands, a little rivulet of clear
water crosses the street, and seems to separate it from the remaining
portion, which, by a steeper declivity, inclined towards the river.
</p>
<p>
Separate, indeed, I might well say, for the two portions are as unlike as
the records of all man&rsquo;s vanity and cruelty are unlike the emblem of Gods
goodness and wisdom. You scarcely cross this tiny stream when the whole
air resounds with the warbling of birds, bright in every tint and hue of
plumage, golden and green, purple and crimson.
</p>
<p>
From the lordly eagle of the Ortiler to the rich-toned linnet of the
Botzen valley, all are there. There, the paroquet of the Stelvio, gorgeous
as the scarlet bustard in plumage; and here, the golden jay of the
Vorarlberg. Blackbirds, thrushes, finches of a hundred different races,
&ldquo;Roth kopfs,&rdquo; and woodpeckers, spring, chirp, flutter, and scream, on
every side. The very atmosphere is tremulous with the sounds, lifelike and
joyous as they are! The very bustle and movement around is such a relief
from the torpid stillness of the other end of the street, where nothing is
heard save the low monotonous tones of some old Jew reading in his
back-shop, or the harsh clank of an iron weapon removed from its place;
while, here, the merry twitter and the silvery-shake recall the greenwood
and the grove, the bright fields and heath-clad mountains.
</p>
<p>
Here is the bird-market of Inspruck. It needs but one passing glance to
shew what attractions the spot possesses for the inhabitants. Every rank,
from the well-salaried official of the government to the humblest burgher&mdash;from
the richly clad noble in his mantle of Astracan, to the peasant in his
dark jacket of sheep&rsquo;s skin&mdash;the field officer and the common soldier&mdash;the
&ldquo;Frau Grafin&rdquo; voluminous in furs&mdash;the &ldquo;Stuben madchen&rdquo; in her woollen
jerkin&mdash;the lounging sexagenarian from his coffee&mdash;the loitering
school-boy returning from school&mdash;all jostle and meet together here;
while the scantiest intimacy with the language will suffice to collect
from the frequently uttered, &ldquo;<i>Wie schön!&rdquo; &ldquo;Ach Gott!&rdquo; &ldquo;Wie wunderschon!</i>&rdquo;
 that admiration and delight are expressed by every tongue among them.
</p>
<p>
It is needless to say, that every corner of this little territory is
familiar to all Inspruckers; not only each shop and its owner, but each
separate treasure. The newly arrived bullfinch, or greywing, having the
notoriety that a Parisian circulates about the last <i>débutante</i> of
the ballet or the opera. If not exactly one of those &ldquo;lions,&rdquo; that
guide-books enforce among the duties of wandering sight-seers, it is at
least a frequent resort of the town&rsquo;s-folk themselves, for whose
gratification it supplies no small proportion of small-talk.
</p>
<p>
Among the well-known and familiar objects of this small world&mdash;for
such the Juden Gasse in reality is&mdash;was a poor boy of some twelve
years old, who, clad in the most wretched rags, and with want in every
feature, used to sit the live-long day on one of the stone benches
watching the birds. It needed but one glance at his bright but unsteady
eye, his faint unmeaning smile, his vague and wild expression, to
recognise that he was bereft of reason. Is it necessary to say this was
poor Fritzerl?
</p>
<p>
Whence he came, who were his parents, how he journeyed thither, no one
could tell! He appeared one morning, when the shop-people were removing
the shutters, sitting close by a window, where the early songs of the
birds was audible, his head bent down to listen, and his whole attitude
betokening the deepest attention. Though he offered no resistance when
they bade him leave the spot, he shewed such deep sorrow and such
reluctance, that he was suffered to remain; and this was now his
dwelling-place. He never quitted it during the day, and there did he pass
the night, under the shelter of the deep arches, and protected by the
fragment of a mantle, which some compassionate neighbour had given him.
All endeavours to induce him to speak were in vain; a sickly smile was his
only answer to a question; and, if pressed too closely, the tears would
come, so that none liked to give him further pain, and the hope of
learning any thing about him, even his name, was given up. Equally
fruitless was every effort to make him perform little services. If the
shopkeepers gave him a bird to carry home for a purchaser, he would at
once sit down beside the cage and gaze wistfully, delightedly, at the
occupant; but he could not be persuaded to quit his abiding-place. Who
could rob one so poor of all the happiness his life compassed? certainly
not the good-natured and kindly folk who inhabited the bird-market.
</p>
<p>
He became then a recognised part of the place, as much as the bustard with
one eye in the corner shop, or the fat old owl that had lived for fifty&mdash;some
said seventy&mdash;years, in the little den with the low iron door. Every
one knew him; few passed without a look of kindness towards him. It was of
no use to give him money, for though he took money when offered, the next
moment he would leave it on the stones, where the street children came and
found it. It was clear he did not understand its meaning. The little
support he needed was freely proffered by the neighbouring shopkeepers,
but he ate nothing save a morsel of dry bread, of which it was remarked
that he each day broke off a small portion and laid it by&mdash;not to eat
later on, for it was seen that he never missed it if removed, nor took it
again if suffered to remain. It was one of the secrets of his nature none
could rightly account for.
</p>
<p>
Although many wealthy and benevolent people of the city wished to provide
the poor, boy with a more comfortable home, the shopkeepers protested
against his removal. Some, loved his innocent, childish features, and
would have missed him sorely; others, were superstitious enough to think,
and even say, that he had brought luck to the bird-market,&mdash;that
every one had prospered since he came there; and some, too, asserted, that
having selected the spot himself, it would be cruel to tear him away from
a place where accustomed and familiar objects had made for him a kind of
home. All these reasonings were backed by the proposal to build for him a
little shed, in the very spot he had taken up, and there leave him to live
in peace. This was accordingly done, and poor Fritz, if not a &ldquo;Burgher of
Inspruck,&rdquo; had at least his own house in the bird-market.
</p>
<p>
Months rolled over: the summer went by, and the autumn itself now drew to
a close; and the various preparations for the coming winter might be seen
in little hand-barrows of firewood deposited before each door, to be split
up and cut in fitting lengths for the stoves. Fur mantles and caps were
hung out to air, and some prudent and well-to-do folks examined the
snow-windows, and made arrangements for their adjustment. Each in his own
way, and according to his means, was occupied with the cares of the
approaching season. There was but one unmoved face in the whole street&mdash;but
one, who seemed to take no note of time or season&mdash;whose past, and
present, and future, were as one. This was Fritz, who sat on his
accustomed bench gazing at the birds, or occasionally moving from his
place to peep into a cage whose occupant lay hid, and then, when satisfied
of its presence, retiring to his seat contented.
</p>
<p>
Had the worthy citizens been less actively engrossed by their own
immediate concerns, or had they been less accustomed to this humble
dependant&rsquo;s presence amongst them, it is likely they would have remarked
the change time had wrought in his appearance. If no actual evidence of
returning reason had evinced itself in his bearing or conduct, his
features displayed at times varieties of expression and meaning very
different from their former monotony. The cheek, whose languid pallor
never altered, would now occasionally flush, and become suddenly scarlet;
the eyes, dull and meaningless, would sparkle and light up; the lips, too,
would part, as if about to give utterance to words. All these signs,
however, would be only momentary, and a degree of depression, even to
prostration, would invariably follow. Unlike his former apathy, too, he
started at sudden noises in the street, felt more interest in the changes
that went on in the shop, and seemed to miss certain birds as they
happened to be sold or exchanged. The most remarkable of all the
alterations in his manner was, that, now, he would often walk down to the
river-side, and pass hours there gazing on the current. Who can say what
efforts at restored reason were then taking place within him&mdash;what
mighty influences were at work to bring back sense and intellect&mdash;what
struggles, and what combats? It would seem as if the brain could exist in
all its integrity&mdash;sound, and intact, and living&mdash;and yet some
essential impulse be wanting which should impart the power of thought.
</p>
<p>
Momentary flashes of intelligence, perhaps, did cross him; but such can no
more suffice for guidance, than does the forked lightning supply the
luminary that gives us day. The landscape preternaturally lit up for a
second, becomes darker than midnight the moment after.
</p>
<p>
Bright and beautiful as that river is, with its thousand eddies whirling
along,&mdash;now, reflecting the tall spires and battlemented towers of
the town&mdash;now, some bold, projecting cliff of those giant mountains
beside it&mdash;how does its rapid stream proclaim its mountain source, as
in large sheets of foam it whirls round the rocky angles of the bank, and
dashes along free as the spirit of its native home! Fritz, came here,
however, less to gaze on this lovely picture than on a scene which each
morning presented to his eyes, close by. This was à garden, where a little
girl of some seven or eight years old used to play, all alone and by
herself, while the old nurse that accompanied her sat knitting in a little
arbour near.
</p>
<p>
The joyous river&mdash;the fresh and balmy air&mdash;the flowers flinging
delicious odours around, and gorgeous in their brilliant tints, only
needed this little infant figure to impart a soul to the scene, and make
it one of ravishing enchantment. Her tiny footsteps on the ground&mdash;her
little song, breathing of innocence and happiness&mdash;the garlands which
she wove, now, to place upon her own fair brow, now, in childish sport to
throw into the clear current&mdash;all imparted to the poor idiot&rsquo;s heart
sensations of intense delight. Who can say if that infant voice did not
wake to feeling the heart that all the wisdom of the learned could not
arouse from its sleep?
</p>
<p>
Not only was Fritz happy while he sat and watched this little child, but,
for the entire day after, he would appear calm and tranquil, and his face
would display the placid expression of a spirit sunk in a pleasing trance.
</p>
<p>
It was not unusual with him, while he was thus gazing, for sleep to come
over him&mdash;a calm, delicious slumber&mdash;from which he awoke far
more refreshed and rested than from his night&rsquo;s repose. Perhaps she was
present in his dreams, and all her playful gestures and her merry tones
were with him while he slept. Perhaps&mdash;it is not impossible&mdash;that
his mind, soothed by the calming influence of, such slumber, recovered in
part its lost power, and not being called on for the exercise of volition,
could employ some of its perceptive faculties.
</p>
<p>
Be this as it may, this sleep was deep, and calm, and tranquillising. One
day, when he had watched longer than usual, and when her childish sport
had more than ever delighted him, he dropped oft* almost suddenly into
slumber. Motionless as death itself he lay upon the bank,&mdash;a faint
smile upon his parted lips, his chest scarcely seeming to heave, so soft
and quiet was his slumber. The river rippled pleasantly beside him, the
air was balmy as in the early spring, and fanned his hot temples with a
delicious breath, the child&rsquo;s song floated merrily out&mdash;the innocent
accents of infant glee&mdash;and Fritz seemed to drink these pleasures in
as he slept.
</p>
<p>
What visions of heavenly shape&mdash;what sounds of angelic sweetness&mdash;may
have flitted before that poor distracted brain, as with clasped hands and
muttering lips he seemed to pray a prayer of thankfulness,&mdash;the
outpouring gratitude of a pent-up nature finding vent at last! Suddenly he
awoke with a start&mdash;terror in every feature&mdash;his eyes starting
from their sockets: he reeled as he sprang to his feet, and almost fell.
The river seemed a cataract&mdash;the mountains leaned over as though they
were about to fall and crush him&mdash;the ground beneath his feet
trembled and shook with an earthquake movement&mdash;a terrible cry rang
through his ears. What could it mean? There!&mdash;there again he heard
it! Oh, what a pang of heart-rending anguish was that! &ldquo;Hülf! hülf! hülf!&rdquo;
 were the words. The infant was struggling in the current&mdash;her little
hand grasped the weeds, while at every instant they gave way&mdash;the
water foamed and eddied round her&mdash;deeper and deeper she sank: her
hair now floated in the stream, and her hands, uplifted, besought, for the
last time, aid. &ldquo;Hülf uns! Maria! hülf uns!&rdquo; She sank. With a cry of
wildest accent, Fritz sprang into the stream, and seized the yellow hair
as it was disappearing beneath the flood: the struggle was severe, for the
strong stream inclined towards the middle of the river, and Fritz could
not swim. Twice had the waves closed over him, and twice he emerged with
his little burden pressed to his heart; were it not for aid, however, his
efforts would have been vain. The cry for help had brought many to the
spot, and he was rescued&mdash;saved from death: saved from that worse
than death&mdash;the terrible union of life and death.
</p>
<p>
He lay upon the bank, wearied and exhausted&mdash;but oh, how happy! How
doubly bright the sky!&mdash;how inexpressibly soft and soothing the air
upon his brow!&mdash;how sweet the human voice, that not only sounded to
the ear but echoed in the heart!
</p>
<p>
In all his bright dreams of life he had fancied nothing like the bliss of
that moment. Friends were on every side of him&mdash;kind friends, who
never in a life-long could tell all their gratitude; and now, with words
of affection, and looks of mildest, fondest meaning, they bent over that
poor boy, and called him their own preserver.
</p>
<p>
Amid all these sights and sounds of gladness&mdash;so full of hope and joy&mdash;there
came one shrill cry, which, piercing the air, seemed to penetrate to the
very inmost chamber of Fritz&rsquo;s heart, telling at once the whole history of
his life, and revealing the secret of his suffering and his victory. It
was Star himself; who, in a cage beneath the spreading branches of a
chestnut-tree, was glad to mingle his wild notes with the concourse of
voices about him, and still continued at intervals to scream out, &ldquo;Maria,
hülf! hülf uns, Maria!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, child,&rdquo; said a venerable old man, as he kissed Fritz&rsquo;s forehead,
&ldquo;you see the fruits of your obedience and your trust. I am glad you have
not forgotten my teaching,&mdash;&lsquo;A good word brings luck.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Every story-teller should respect those who like to hear a tale to its
very end. The only way he can evince his gratitude for their patience is
by gratifying all their curiosity. It remains for me, then, to say, that
Fritz returned to the little village where he had lived with Star for his
companion; not poor and friendless as before, but rich in wealth, and
richer in what is far better&mdash;the grateful love and affection of kind
friends. His life henceforth was one of calm and tranquil happiness. By
his aid the old Bauer was enabled to purchase his little farm rent-free,
and buy besides several cows and some sheep. And then, when he grew up to
be a man, Fritz married Grett&rsquo;la, and they became very well off, and lived
in mutual love and contentment all their lives.
</p>
<p>
Fritz&rsquo;s house was not only the handsomest in the Dorf, but it was
ornamented with a little picture of the Virgin, with Star sitting upon her
wrist, and the words of the golden letters were inscribed beneath,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Maria, Mutter Gottes, hülf uns!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Within, nothing could be more comfortable than to see Fritz and Grett&rsquo;la
at one side of the fire, and the old Bauer reading aloud, and the &ldquo;Frau&rdquo;
 listening, and Star, who lived to a great age, walking proudly about, as
if he was conscious that he had some share in producing the family
prosperity; and close to the stove, on a little low seat made on purpose,
sat a little old man, with a long pigtail and very shrunken legs: this was
old Cristoph the postilion&mdash;and who had a better right?
</p>
<p>
Fritz was so much loved and respected by the villagers, that they elected
him Vorsteher, or rector of the Dorf; and when he died&mdash;very old at
last&mdash;they all, several hundreds, followed him respectfully to the
grave, and, in memory of his story, called the village Maria Hülf, which
is its name to this day.

CHAPTER III.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
<i>Varenna, Lake of Como</i>.
</pre>
<p>
Italy at last! I have crossed the Alps and reached my goal, and now I turn
and look at that winding road which, for above two thousand feet,
traverses the steep mountain-side, and involuntarily a sadness steals over
me&mdash;that I am never to re-cross it! These same &ldquo;last-times&rdquo; are very
sorrowful things, all emblems as they are of that one great &ldquo;last-time&rdquo;
 when the curtain falls for ever! Nor am I sorry when this feeling
impresses me deeply; nay, I am pleased that indifference&mdash;apathy&mdash;have
no more hold upon me. I am more afraid of that careless, passionless
temperament, than of aught else, and the more as hour by hour it steals
over me. Yesterday a letter, which once would have interested me deeply,
lay half read till evening; to-day, a very old friend of my guardian&rsquo;s,
Sir Gordon Howard, has left his card: he is ill the inn, perhaps in the
next room, and I have not energy to return his visit and chat with him
over friends I am never to see again. And yet he is a gallant old officer,&mdash;one
of that noble class of Englishmen whose loyalty made the boldest feats of
daring, the longest years of servitude, seem only as a duty they owed
their sovereign. The race is dying out fast.
</p>
<p>
What can have brought him to Italy? Let me see. Here is the Traveller&rsquo;s
Book; perhaps it may tell something.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sir Gordon Howard, Officier Anglais,&rdquo;&mdash;simple enough for a
Major-general and K.C.B. and G.C.H.&mdash;&ldquo;de Zurich à Como.&rdquo; Not much to
be learned from that. But stay! he is not alone. &ldquo;Mademoiselle Howard.&rdquo;
 And who can she be? He never had a daughter, and his only son is in India.
Perhaps she is a grandaughter; but what care I? It is but another reason
to avoid seeing him. I cannot make new acquaintances now. He wants no
companions who must travel the road I am going! Antoine must tell me when
Sir Gordon Howard goes out, and I&rsquo;ll leave my card then. I feel I must
remain here to-day, and I am well content to do so. This calm lake, these
bold mountains, the wooded promontory of Bellagio, and its bright villas,
seen amid the trees, are pleasant sights; while from the ever-passing
boats, with their white arched awnings, I hear laughter and voices of
happy people, whose hearts are lighter than my own.
</p>
<p>
If I could only find resolution for the task, too, there are a host of
letters lying by me unanswered. How little do some of those &ldquo;dear friends&rdquo;
 who invite one to shoot grouse in the Highlands, or hunt in
Leicestershire, think of the real condition of those they ask to be their
guests! It is enough that you have been seen in certain houses of a
certain repute. You have visited at B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, and spent a
Christmas at G&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;; you are known as a tolerable shot and
a fair average talker; you are sufficiently recognised in the world as to
be known to all men of a very general acceptance, and no more is wanted.
But, test this kind of position by absence! Try, if you will, what a few
years out of England effect! You are as totally forgotten as though you
belonged to a past generation. You expect&mdash;naturally enough, perhaps&mdash;to
resume your old place and among your old associates; but where are they?
and what have they become? You left them young men about town, you find
them now among the &ldquo;middle ages;&rdquo; when you parted they were slim, lank,
agile fellows, that could spring into a saddle and fly their horse over a
five-bar rail, or pull an oar with any one. Now, they are of the portly
order, wear wider-skirted coats, trousers without straps, and cloth boots;
their hats, too, have widened in the leaf, so as to throw a more liberal
shade over broader cheeks; the whiskers are more bushy, and less accurate
in curl. If they ride, the horse has more bone and timber under him; and
when they bow to some fair face in a passing carriage there is no
brightening of the eye, but in its place a look of easier intimacy than
heretofore. These are not the men you left?&mdash;alas they are! A new
generation of young men about town has sprung up, who &ldquo;know not Joseph,&rdquo;
 and with whom you have few, if any, sympathies.
</p>
<p>
So I find it myself. I left England at a time when pleasure was the mad
pursuit of every young fellow; and under that designation came every
species of extravagance and all kind of wild excess. Men of five thousand
a-year were spending twelve! Men of twelve, thirty! Every season saw some
half-dozen cross the Channel, &ldquo;cleared out&rdquo;&mdash;some, never more to be
heard of. Others, lingering in Paris or Brussels to confer with their
lawyer, who was busily engaged in compromising, contesting, disputing, and
bullying a host of creditors, whose very rogueries had accomplished the
catastrophe they grumbled at. Lords, living on ten or twelve hundred
pounds a-year were to be met with everywhere; Countesses, lodged in every
little town in Germany. The Dons of dragoon regiments were seen a-foot in
the most obscure of watering-places; and men who had loomed large at
Doncaster, and booked thousands, were now fain to risk francs and florins
among the flats of Brussels and Aix-la-Chapelle. The pace was tremendous;
few who came of age with a good estate held out above two or three years.
And if any listener should take his place beside a group of
fashionable-looking young Englishmen in the Boulevard de Grand, or the
Graben at Vienna, the chances were greatly in favour of his hearing such
broken phrases as, &ldquo;Caught it heavily!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;All wrong at Ascot!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Scott&rsquo;s
fault!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Cleared out at Crocky&rsquo;s!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No standing two hundred
per cent!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Infernal scoundrel, Ford!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That villain
Columbine!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Rascal Bevan!&rdquo; and so on, with various allusions to the
Quorn hounds, the Clarendon, and Houlditch the coach-maker.
</p>
<p>
Such was the one song you heard every where.
</p>
<p>
Now the mode&mdash;a better one I willingly own it&mdash;is &ldquo;Young
Englandism.&rdquo; Not that superb folly of white neckcloth and vest, that
swears by Disraeli and the &ldquo;Morning Post,&rdquo; but that healthier stamp, whose
steps of travel have turned eastward, towards the land of old-world
wonders, and who, instead of enervating mind and body at Ems or Baden,
seek higher and nobler sources of pleasure among the cities and tombs of
ancient Egypt. Lord Lindsay, for instance, what a creditable specimen is
he of his age and class! and Warburton&rsquo;s book, the &ldquo;Crescent and the
Cross,&rdquo; how redeeming is such a production among the mass of frivolity and
flippancy the magazines teem with! These are the men who, returning to
England more intensely national than they left it, cannot be reproached
with ignorance in this preference of their native land above every other.
Their nationality, not built up of the leaders of the daily newspapers, is
a conviction resulting from reflection and comparison.
</p>
<p>
They are proud of England; not alone as the most powerful of nations, but
as that where personal integrity and truth are held in highest repute&mdash;where
character and reputation stand far above genius&mdash;and where, whatever
the eminence of a gifted man, he cannot stand above his fellows, save on
the condition that he is not inferior in more sterling qualities. The
young man setting out to travel can scarcely be sustained by a better
feeling than his strong nationality. He who sets a high store by the
character of his country will be slow to do aught that will disgrace it.
Of course I speak of nationality in its true sense; not the affectation of
John Bullism in dress, manner, and bearing&mdash;not the insolent
assumption of superiority to the French and Germans, that some very young
men deem English; but, a deep conviction that, as the requirements of
England are higher in all that regards fidelity to his word, consistency
of conduct, and more honourable employment of time and talents than
prevail abroad, he should be guardedly careful not to surrender these
convictions to all the seductions of foreign life and manners.
</p>
<p>
I do not believe our country is superior to any foreign land in any one
particular so strikingly as in the capabilities and habits of our higher
orders. Such a class as the titled order of Great Britain, taking them
collectively, never existed elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
A German, with any thing like independence, lives a life of
tobacco-smoking and snipe-shooting. An Italian, is content to eke out life
with a <i>café</i> and a theatre&mdash;lemonade and a &ldquo;<i>liaison</i>&rdquo; are
enough for him. The government of foreign states, in shutting out the men
of rank and fortune from political influence, have taken the very shortest
road to their degradation. What is to become of a man who has a
Bureaucracy for a government and Popery for a religion?
</p>
<p>
But what is the tumult in the little court-yard beneath my window? Ha! an
English equipage! How neatly elegant that low-hung phaeton! and how superb
in figure and style that pair of powerful dark-brown thoroughbreds!&mdash;for
so it is easy to see they are, even to the smart groom, who stands so
still before the pole, with each hand upon the bars of the bits. All smack
of London. There is an air of almost simplicity in the whole turn-out,
because it is in such perfect keeping. And here come its owners. What a
pretty foot!&mdash;I might almost say, and ankle, too! How gracefully she
draws her shawl around her! What! my friend Sir Gordon himself? So, this
is Mdlle. Howard! I wish I could see her face. She will not turn this way.
And now they are gone. How distinctive is the proud tramp of their feet
above the shuffling shamble of the posters!
</p>
<p>
So, it is only a &ldquo;<i>piccolo giro</i>&rdquo; they are gone to make along the
lake, and come back again, to dinner. I thought I heard him say my name to
his valet, as he stepped into the carriage. Who knocks at the door? I was
right; Sir Gordon has sent to invite me to dine at six o&rsquo;clock. Shall I
go? Why should I think of it? I am sick, low, weak, heart and body. Nay,
it is better to refuse.
</p>
<p>
Well, I have written my apology, not without a kind of secret regret, for
somehow I have a longing&mdash;a strange wish, once more, to feel the
pleasant excitement of even so much of society; but, like the hero of the
Peau de Chagrin, I dread to indulge a wish, for it may lead me more
rapidly down to my doom. I actually tremble lest a love of life, that
all-absorbing desire to live, should lie in wait for me yet. I have heard
that it ever accompanies the last stage of my malady. It is better, then,
to guard against whatever might suggest it. Pleasure could not&mdash;friendship,
solicitude, kindness might do so.

<h2>
CHAPTER IV. <i>Villa Cimarosa, Logo di Como</i>.
</h2>
<p>
It is a week since I wrote a line in my notebook, and, judging only from
my sensations, it seems like a year. Events rapidly succeeding, always
make time seem longer in retrospect. It is only monotony is brief to look
back upon.
</p>
<p>
I expected ere this to have been at Naples, if not Palermo; and here I
linger on the Lake of Como, as if my frail health had left me any choice
of a resting-place. And yet, why should this not be as healthful as it is
beautiful?
</p>
<p>
Looking out from this window, beneath which, not three paces distant, the
blue lake is plashing&mdash;the music of its waves the only sound heard&mdash;great
mountains rise grandly from the water to the very skies, the sides one
tangled mass of olive, vine, and fig-tree. The dark-leaved laurel, the
oleander, the cactus and the magnolia cluster around each rugged rocky
eminence, and hang in graceful drapery over the glassy water. Palaces,
temples, and villas are seen on every side; some, boldly standing out, are
reflected in the calm lake, their marble columns tremulous as the gentle
wind steals past; others, half hid among the embowering trees, display but
a window or a portico, or perchance a deep arched entrance for the
gondolas, above which some heavy banner slowly waves its drooping folds,
touching the very water. The closed jalousies, the cloudless sky, the
unruffled water, over which no boat is seen to glide, the universal
stillness, all tell that it is noon&mdash;the noon of Italy, and truly the
northern midnight is not a season of such unbroken repose. Looking at this
scene, and fancying to myself the lethargic life of ease, which not even
thought disturbs, of these people, I half wonder within me how had it
fared with us of England beneath such a sun, and in such a clime. Had the
untiring spirit of enterprise, the active zeal and thirst for wealth,
triumphed over every obstacle, and refused to accept, as a season of rest,
the hours of the bright and glaring sunshine?
</p>
<p>
Here, the very fishermen are sleeping beneath their canvass awnings, and
their boats lie resting in the dark shadows. There is something
inexpressibly calm and tranquillising in all this. The stillness of night
we accept as its natural and fitting accompaniment, but to look out upon
this fair scene, one is insensibly reminded of the condition of life which
leaves these busiest of mortal hours, elsewhere, free to peaceful repose,
and with how little labour all wants are met and satisfied.
</p>
<p>
How came I here? is a question rising to my mind at every moment, and
actually demanding an effort of memory to answer. The very apartment
itself is almost a riddle to me, seeming like some magic transformation,
realising as it does all that I could ask or wish.
</p>
<p>
This beautiful little octagon room, with its marble &ldquo;statuettes&rdquo; in niches
between the windows, its frescoed ceiling, its white marble floor,
reflecting each graceful ornament, even to the silver lamp that hangs high
in the coved roof; and then, this little terrace beside the lake, where
under the silk awning I sit among a perfect bosquet of orange and oleander
trees;&mdash;it is almost too beautiful for reality. I try to read, but
cannot; and as I write I stand up at each moment to peep over the balcony
at the fish, as sluggishly they move along, or, at the least stir, dart
forward with arrowy speed, to return again the minute after, for they have
been fed here and know the spot. There is a dreamy, visionary feeling,
that seems to be the spirit of the place, encouraging thought, and yet
leading the mind to dalliance rather than moody reverie. And again, how
came I here? Now for the answer.
</p>
<p>
On Tuesday last I was at Varenna, fully bent on proceeding by Milan to
Genoa, and thence to Naples. I had, not without some difficulty, resisted
all approaches of Sir Gordon Howard, and even avoided meeting him. What
scores of fables did I invent merely to escape an interview with an old
friend!
</p>
<p>
Well, at eight o&rsquo;clock, as I sat at breakfast, I heard the bustle of
preparation in the court-yard, and saw with inexpressible relief that his
horses were standing ready harnessed, while my valet came with the welcome
tidings that the worthy Baronet was starting for Como, near which he had
taken a Villa. The Villa Cimarosa, the most beautiful on the lake,&mdash;frescoes&mdash;statues&mdash;hanging
gardens&mdash;I know not how many more charming items, did my informant
recite, with all the impassioned eloquence of George Robins himself. He
spared me nothing, from the news that Mademoiselle, Sir Gordon&rsquo;s
grandaughter, who was a prodigious heiress, was ordered to Italy for her
health, and that it was more than likely we should find them at Naples for
the winter, down to the less interesting fact that the courier, Giacomo
Bartoletti, was to proceed by the steamer and get the Villa ready for
their arrival. I could only stop his communications by telling him to
order horses for Lecco, pay the bill, and follow me, as I should stroll
down the road and look at the caverns of rock which it traverses by the
lake side.
</p>
<p>
I had seen Sir Gordon drive off&mdash;I had heard the accustomed &ldquo;<i>Buon
viaggio</i>&rdquo; uttered by the whole household in chorus&mdash;and now, I was
free once more; and so escaping this noisy ceremony of leave-taking, I
sauntered listlessly forth, and took my way along the lake. The morning
was delicious; a slight breeze from the north, the pleasantest of all the
winds on the Lake of Como, was just springing up.
</p>
<p>
It is here, opposite Varenna, that the lake is widest; but nothing of
bleakness results from the greater extent of water, for the mountains are
still bold and lofty, and the wooded promontory of Bellagio dividing the
two reaches of the lake, is a beautiful feature. Its terraced gardens and
stately palaces peeping amid the leafy shade, and giving glimpses of one
of the sweetest spots the &ldquo;Villégiatura&rdquo; ever lingered in.
</p>
<p>
I had got a considerable distance from the town of Varenna without feeling
it. The enchanting picture, ever presenting some new effect, and the light
and buoyant breeze from the water, and a certain feeling of unusual
lightness of heart, all aiding, I walked on without fatigue; nor was I
aware of the distance traversed, till at a little bend of the lake I saw
Varenna diminishing away&mdash;its tall poplars and taper spires being now
the most conspicuous features of the town.
</p>
<p>
At a short distance in front of me lay a little creek or bay, from one
side of which a wooden pier projected&mdash;a station for the steamers
that ply on the lake. There now Sir Gordon Howard&rsquo;s phaeton was standing,
surrounded with a most multifarious heap of trunks, packing-cases,
portmanteaus, and other travelling gear&mdash;signs that some portion of
his following, at least, were awaiting the arrival of the packet. Nor had
they to wait long: for as I looked, the vessel shot round the rocky point
and darted swiftly across the smooth water, till she lay scarce moving,
about a quarter of a mile from shore,&mdash;the shoal water prevented her
approaching nearer to the jetty.
</p>
<p>
With the idle curiosity of a lounger, I sat down on a rock to watch the
scene.
</p>
<p>
I know no reason for it, but I ever take an interest in the movements of
travellers. Their comings and goings suggest invariably some amusing
pictures to my mind, and many a story have I weaved for myself from
nothing but the passing glimpses of those landed hurriedly from a steamer.
</p>
<p>
I watched, therefore, with all my usual satisfaction, the launching of the
boat laden heavily with luggage, on the top of which, like its presiding
genius, sat a burly courier, his gold-banded cap glistening brightly in
the sun. Then came a lighter skiff, in the stern of which sat a female
figure, shaded by a pink parasol. There was another parasol in the phaeton
too&mdash;I thought I could even recognise Sir Gordon&rsquo;s figure in the last
boat: but as I looked the sky became suddenly overcast, and round the
rocky point, where but a moment before the whole cliff lay reflected in
the water, there now came splashing waves, tumbling wildly by, till the
whole creek suddenly was covered by them; dark squalls of wind sweeping
over the water, tossing the two boats to and fro, and even heaving up the
huge steamer itself, till her bows were bathed in foaming cataracts. The
suddenness of the tempest&mdash;for such it really was&mdash;was a grand
and sublime &ldquo;effect&rdquo; in such a scene: but I could no longer enjoy it, as
there seemed to be actual danger in the situation of the two boats, which,
from time to time, were hidden between the swelling waves. At last, but
not without a struggle, they reached the packet, and I could plainly see,
by the signs of haste on board, that the captain had not been a very
willing spectator of the scene. The luggage was soon on board, and the
figures of the lighter boat followed quickly after.
</p>
<p>
Scarcely was this effected when the boats were cast off, and again the
paddle-wheels splashed through the water. The gale at this instant
increased: for no sooner was the steamer&rsquo;s bow to the wind, than the waves
went clean over her, washing her deck from stem to stern, and dashing in
columns of spray over the dark funnel. A great stir and commotion on deck
drew off my attention from the boats; and now I heard a hoarse voice
calling through a speaking-trumpet to those in the boats. They, however,
either did not hear or heed the command, for they rowed boldly towards the
shore, nor once paid any attention to the signals which, first as a flag,
and afterwards as a cannon-shot, the steamer made for them.
</p>
<p>
While I was lost in conjecturing what possibly all this might mean, the
vessel once more rounded to her course, and with full steam up breasted
the rolling water, and stood out towards the middle of the lake. A
fisherman just then ran his boat in to land, in a little creek beneath me,
and from him I asked an explanation of the scene.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, Signor, but what one sees almost every day here,&rdquo; said he,
jeeringly: &ldquo;that &lsquo;<i>canaille</i>&rsquo; of Pellagino have taken people out to
the steamer, and would not wait to bring them back again; and now, they
must go to Como, whether they will or no.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This explanation seemed the correct one, and appeared to be corroborated
by the attitude of the party on shore, for there stood the phaeton, still
waiting, although all chance of the others&rsquo; returning was totally by-gone.
Concluding that, Sir Gordon thus carried off without his will, his
servants might possibly need some advice or counsel&mdash;for I knew they
were all English, except the Courier&mdash;I hastened down to the jetty,
to offer them such aid as I possessed. As I came nearer, I was more
convinced that my suspicions were correct. About thirty ragged and not
over-prepossessing-looking individuals were assembled around the phaeton;
some busily pressing the groom, who stood at the horses&rsquo; heads, with
questions he could not answer; and others imploring charity with all that
servile tone and gesture your Italian beggar is master of. Making my way
through this assemblage, I accosted the groom, who knew me to be an
acquaintance of his master&rsquo;s, and instead of replying to me, at once cried
out,&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, Miss Lucy, here is Mr. Templeton! You need not be afraid,
now.&rdquo; I turned at once, and instead of a lady&rsquo;s-maid, as I had believed
the figure to be, beheld a very lovely but delicate-looking girl, who with
an expression of considerable anxiety in her features, was still following
the track of the departing steam-boat. At the mention of my name she
looked hurriedly around, and a deep blush covered her face as she said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am so happy to see Mr. Templeton! Perhaps he will forgive me if I make
the first moment of our acquaintance the burden of a request?&rdquo; And then,
in a very few words, she told me how her Grandfather, having gone on board
the steamer to give some particular orders and directions about his
baggage, was unwillingly carried off, leaving her with only a groom, who
could speak no language but his own. She went on to say, that they had
taken the Villa Cimarosa on the lake, and were then proceeding thither by
Lecco, when this <i>mésaventure</i> occurred.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I now must ask Mr. Templeton&rsquo;s counsel how to act&mdash;whether to return
to the inn at Varenna, and wait there till I can hear from my Grandfather,
or venture on to Como with the carriage?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If you will take my carriage, Miss Howard, it will be here in a few
minutes. My servant is a most experienced traveller, and will not suffer
you to endure the slightest inconvenience; and I will follow in yours.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But perhaps you cannot travel in an open carriage? I have heard that your
health is delicate.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I prefer it greatly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And I too&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She stopped suddenly, feeling that she was about to utter what might seem
an ungracious acknowledgment. There was such an evident regret in the
dread of having offended me, that, without pausing to reflect, I said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is another alternative; I am a very safe whip, and if you would
permit me to have the honour of accompanying you, I should be but too
happy to be your escort.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She tried to answer by a polite smile of acceptance, but I saw that the
proposition was scarcely such as she approved of, and so at once I added,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I will spare you the pain of rejecting my offer; pray, then, abide by my
first suggestion. I see my carriage coming along yonder.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said she, with a kind of wilfulness, like that of one who
had been long accustomed to indulgence; &ldquo;it may seem very capricious to
you, but I own I detest post-horses, and cracking whips, and rope-harness.
You shall drive me, Mr. Templeton.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I replied by a very sincere assurance of how I esteemed the favour, and
the next moment was seated at her side. As I stole a glance at the pale
but beautifully-formed features, her drooping eyelashes, dark as night,
and her figure of surpassing symmetry and grace, I could not help thinking
of all the straits and expedients I had practised for three entire days to
avoid making her acquaintance. As if she had actually divined what was
then passing in my mind, she said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You see, Mr. Temple ton, it was like a fate; you did your utmost not to
meet us, and here we are, after all.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I stammered out a very eager, but a very blundering attempt at denial,
while she resumed,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pray do not make matters worse, which apologies in such cases always do.
Grandpapa told me that ill health had made you a recluse and avoid
society. This, and the mystery of your own close seclusion, were quite
enough to make me desirous to see you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How flattered I should have been had I suspected so much interest could
attach to me! but, really, I dreaded to inflict upon a very old friend
what I found to be so tiresome, namely, my own company.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I always heard that you were fastidious about going into society; but
surely a visit to an old friend, in a foreign country too, might have
escaped being classified in this category?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I own my fault, which, like most faults, has brought its own penalty.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If this be meant to express your deep affliction at not coming to us, I
accept the speech in all its most complimentary sense.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I bowed in acquiescence, and she went on:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You must forgive me if I talk to you with a freedom that our actual
acquaintanceship does not warrant, for, while <i>you</i> never heard of me
before, <i>I</i> have been listening to stories and narratives about <i>you</i>,
I cannot say how long.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed! I scarcely suspected Sir Gordon had more than remembered me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I did not say that Grandpapa was my informant,&rdquo; said she, laughing. &ldquo;Lady
Catherine Douglas&mdash;the Collingwoods&mdash;the Grevilles&mdash;and
then that delightful person, Madame de Favancourt,&mdash;all spoke of
you.... For which of my catalogue was that blush intended, Mr. Templeton?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was only yielding to a very natural sentiment&mdash;call it shame,
pride, or pleasure&mdash;that so many fair friends should have deemed me
worthy a place in their memory. Is Mary Greville married?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; about a month since she accepted the hand she had, it is said, some
half-dozen times rejected.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sir Blake Morony?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The same: an intolerable bore, to my thinking; and, indeed, I believe to
poor Mary&rsquo;s, too. But, then, &lsquo;the&rsquo; man did not offer. Some say, he was
bashful; some, that he dreaded what he need not have dreaded&mdash;a
refusal; and so, Mary went but to the Cape when her father became Governor
there; and, like all governors&rsquo; daughters, took a husband from the staff.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She was very pretty, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Say on; we were never more than mere acquaintances.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was going to add, a most inveterate flirt.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How I do detest to hear that brought as an accusation against a girl,
from the very kind of person that invariably induces the error!&mdash;Young
men like Mr. Templeton, who, entering life with the prestige of ability
and public success, very naturally flatter the vanity of any girl by their
attentions, and lead to a more buoyant character of mind and a greater
desire to please, which are at once set down as coquetry. For my own part,
I greatly prefer old men&rsquo;s society to young one&rsquo;s, from the very fact that
one is permitted to indulge all the caprices of thought or fancy without
incurring the offensive imputation of a design on his heart.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I should not always give a verdict of acquittal even in such cases.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very likely not. There are old men whose manner and bearing are
infinitely more attractive than the self-satisfied, self-relying composure
of our modern young ones. Any thing, however, even boyish awkwardness, is
preferable to your middle-aged gentleman, who, with a slight bald spot on
his head, and a very permanent flush on his cheek, adds the stately pomp
of his forty autumns to a levity that has no touch of younger days.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Heaven help us! what are we to do from thirty to fifty-five or sixty?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Marry, and live in the country. I mean, do not be young men about town.
<i>Apropos</i> to nothing&mdash;are we not, this instant, in the very
scene of Manzoni&rsquo;s novel, &lsquo;I Promessi Sposi?&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; the whole of our journey to-day lies through it, from Lecco to Como;
or rather, more to the northward again&mdash;what they call here, the
‘Brianza.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The scene deserved better actors, in my opinion. I have always thought it
a very tiresome story, even among that most tiresome class&mdash;Pure
love-tales.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What say you to the &lsquo;Bride of Lammermoor?&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That it is only inferior to &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet.&rsquo; But how many interests
are there brought up before the reader in either of these&mdash;all
subordinate to the great one&mdash;but all exciting mingled and
conflicting emotions! The author, in neither case, was satisfied to dwell
on the daily and nightly sighings of a love-stricken pair. He knew better
than to weave his web of one tissue. In fact, the Master of Ravens-wood is
more the slave of his own blighted ambition than of his love, which, at
best, was only an element in his feeling of abasement.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And yet, how faithfully was his love returned! Nothing short of a true
passion meets such requital.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If you said, that no heart incapable of feeling ever inspired such, I
would agree with you; but I fancy that women are often imposed upon, by
supposing that they possess the entire affection of those they know
capable of strong attachments.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That may possibly be true; but I suspect that in the world&mdash;in the
middle of that life where we daily meet and form friendships&mdash;there
is very little time or opportunity for any thing above a passing feeling
of admiration, that seldom reaches esteem. The Honourable Miss Tollemache
meets Captain Fitzherbert of the Guards. They are introduced and dance
together&mdash;the lady is pretty&mdash;the Captain amusing&mdash;they
have a large number of mutual acquaintances, whom they quiz and praise by
turns, with sufficient agreement to be mutually pleased. They separate;
and the Captain asks if the lady really have &lsquo;twenty thousand pounds
fortune.&rsquo; Match-making aunts and mothers arrange preliminaries; and the
young people have leisure to fail in love after the most approved fashion:
that is, they meet very often, and talk more together, than common
acquaintances are wont to do; but their talk is of Grisi and Lablache, of
the Duke&rsquo;s fete at Chiswick, and Lord Donnington&rsquo;s yacht excursion to
Malta. If the gentleman have a confidence to evoke, it is, possibly, the
state of his mind on the approaching &lsquo;Derby.&rsquo; Now I would ask, How much of
mutual esteem, or even knowledge, grows out of all this?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pretty much the same amount as exists in a French marriage, where M. le
Marquis having &lsquo;<i>fait ses farces</i>,&rsquo; is fain to marry, being somewhat
too deep in debt to continue what his years admonish him to abandon.
Mademoiselle is brought from the convent, or the governess&rsquo;s apartment, to
sign the contract and accept her husband. There is enough in the very
emancipation she obtains to be pleasurable, not to speak of a grand <i>trousseau</i>,
diamonds, cashmeres, and the prettiest equipage in Paris.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Hence,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we seem agreed, that one must not choose a wife or
husband <i>à la mode Anglaise ni Française</i>.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I believe not,&rdquo; said she, laughing; &ldquo;for if marriages be made in heaven,
they are about the strangest employment for angels I ever heard of.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It entirely depends on how you regard what are commonly called accidents
and chances, as to the interpretation you give that saying. If you see, in
those curious coincidences that are ever occurring in life, nothing more
than hazard, you at once abandon all idea of governing human actions. If,
on the other hand, you read them too implicitly, and accept them as
indications for the future, you rush into fatalism. For my own part, I
think less of the events themselves, than as they originate or evoke
sentiments in two parties, who, though previously known to each, only
discover on some sudden emergency a wonderful agreement in sentiment and
feeling. In the ordinary detail of life they had gone on, each ignorant of
the other&rsquo;s opinions: so long as the wheels of life revolved freely and
noiselessly, the journey had called for nothing of mutual interest; but
some chance occurrence, some accidental rencontre occurs, and they at once
perceive a most fortuitous similarity in taste or thinking. Like people
who have suddenly discovered a long-persisted-in mistake, they hasten to
repair the past by sudden confidences. Let me give an instance, even
though it be almost too bold a one for my theory. A friend of mine, who
had served some years with great distinction in the East, returned to
England in company with a brother officer, a man of high family, knowing
and known to every one of a certain standing in London. My friend, who,
from a remote province, had no town acquaintances, was, however, speedily
introduced by his friend, and, heralded by his reputation, was greatly
noticed in society. He soon wearied of a round of dissipations, wherein
the great, if not the only interest, lies in knowledge of the actors; and
was one night stealing away from a large evening party, secretly resolving
that it should be his last ball. He had, by dint of great labour and
perseverance, reached the last salon, and already-caught glimpse of the
stair beyond, when his progress was suddenly arrested by a very sweet but
excited voice, saying&mdash;&lsquo;One moment, sir; may I beg you will release
my scarf.&rsquo; He turned and beheld a very handsome girl, who was endeavouring
to disengage from her shoulders a rich scarf of lace, one end of which was
caught in the star he wore on his breast&mdash;a decoration from the
Nizam. He immediately began to detach the delicate tissue from its
dangerous situation. But his address was inferior to his zeal, so that he
continually received admonitions as to greater care and caution, with
mingled laments over the inevitable mischief that must follow. Something
abashed by his own awkwardness, his nervousness made him worse, and he
muttered to himself in German, thinking it was a safe tongue for soliloquy&mdash;&lsquo;Why
will ladies wear such preposterous finery?&mdash;the spider&rsquo;s web is not
so fragile.&rsquo; To which at once the lady replied, in the same language,&mdash;&lsquo;If
men are vain enough to carry a coat full of &lsquo;<i>crachats</i>&rsquo; and orders,
ladies ought, at least, to be careful how they pass them.&rsquo; He blushed at
the tart rebuke, and in his eagerness he tore a little hoop or mesh of the
scarf. &lsquo;Oh, pray sir, permit me! It is real Brussels!&rsquo; and so saying, she
at once began, with a skill very different from his, the work of
disentanglement. My friend, however, did not desist, but gave what aid he
could, their fingers more than once meeting. Meanwhile a running fire of
pleasantry and smartness went on between them, when suddenly his brother
officer came up, saying,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh! Lydia, here is my friend Collyton. I have been so anxious you should
know him; and he leaves to-morrow.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I hope he will permit me to rescue my scarf first,&rsquo; said the lady,
taking no heed of the introduction.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I am so sorry&mdash;I really am in despair,&rsquo; said Collyton, as the lady,
growing at last impatient, tore the frail web in order to get free.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;It was all your fault, sir, remember that&mdash;or rather that of your
star, which I&rsquo;m sure I wish the Sirdar, or the Nizam, had reserved for a
more careful wearer.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I never deemed it would have done me such service,&rsquo; said Collyton,
recovering courage; &lsquo;without it, I should have passed on, and you would
never have taken the trouble to notice me.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;There, sir, I must leave you your prize,&rsquo; said she, smartly, as, taking
the arm of her partner, she joined the waltzers; while Collyton stood with
the folds of a Brussels veil draped gracefully on his arm.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He went home; spent half the night disengaging the intricate web, and the
next day called to restore it, and apologise for his misfortune; the
acquaintance thus casually formed ripened into mutual liking, and, after a
time, into a stronger feeling, and in the end they were married; the whole
of the event, the great event of every life, originating in the porcupine
fashion of the Nizam&rsquo;s star and the small loops of a Brussels-lace scarf!
Here, then, is my case; but for this rencontre they had never met, save in
the formal fashion people do as first acquaintances. Without a certain
collision, they had not given forth the sparks that warmed into flame.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I call that a pure chance, just as much as&mdash;as&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Our own meeting this morning, you were about to say,&rdquo; said I, laughingly;
and she joined in the mirth, but soon after became silent and thoughtful.
I tried various ways of renewing our conversation; I started new topics,
miles remote from all we had been talking of: but I soon perceived that,
whether from physical causes or temperament, the eager interest she
exhibited when speaking, and the tone of almost excited animation in which
she listened, seemed to weary and exhaust her. I therefore gradually
suffered our conversation to drop down to an occasional remark on passing
objects; and so we travelled onwards till, late in the afternoon, we found
ourselves at the gate of a handsome park, where an avenue of trellised
vines, wide enough for two carriages to pass, led to a beautiful villa, on
the terrace of which stood my old friend, Sir Gordon Howard, himself.
</p>
<p>
For a few moments he was so totally engrossed by the meeting with his
grandaughter that he did not even perceive me. Indeed, his agitation was
as great as it might reasonably have been had years of absence separated
them, instead of the few brief hours of a twenty miles&rsquo; drive; and it was
only as she said, &ldquo;Are you forgetting to thank Mr. Templeton, Papa?&rdquo; that
he turned round to greet me with all the warmth of his kindly nature.
</p>
<p>
It was to no purpose that I protested plans already formed, engagements
made, and horses written for; he insisted on my staying, if not some weeks&mdash;some
days&mdash;and at last, hours, at the Villa Cimarosa. I might still have
resisted his kind entreaties, when Miss Howard, with a smile and a manner
of most winning persuasiveness, said, &ldquo;I wish you would stay,&rdquo;&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;here
I am!

<h2>
CHAPTER V. <i>La Villa Cimarosa, October</i>
</h2>
<p>
How like a dream&mdash;a delicious, balmy, summer night&rsquo;s dream&mdash;is
this life I am leading! For the first time have I tasted the soothing
tranquillity of domestic life. A uniformity, that tells rather of security
than sameness, pervades every thing in this well-ordered household, where
all come and go as if under the guidance of some ruling genius, unseen and
unheard. Sir Gordon, too, is like a father; at least as I can fancy a
father to be, for I was too early left an orphan to preserve my memory of
either parent. His kindness is even more than what we call friendship. It
is actually paternal. He watches over my health with all the unobtrusive
solicitude of true affection; and if I even hint at departure, he seizes
the occasion to oppose it, not with the warmth of hospitality alone, but a
more deeply-meaning interest that sometimes puzzles me. Can it be that he
recognises in my weakened frame and shrunken cheek, greater ravages of
disease than I yet feel or know of? Is it that he perceives me nearer the
goal than as yet I am aware? It was yesterday, as we sat in the library
together, running over the pages of an almanac, I remarked something about
my liking to travel by moonlight, when, with a degree of emotion that
amazed me, he said, &ldquo;Pray do not talk of leaving us; I know that in this
quiet monotony there may be much to weary you; but remember that you are
not strong enough for the world, did you even care to take your place in
it as of old. Besides,&rdquo;&mdash;here he faltered, and it was with a great
effort that he resumed&mdash;&ldquo;besides, for <i>my</i> sake, if the
selfishness of the request should not deter you, for <i>my</i> sake remain
with us some time longer.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I protested most warmly, as I had all reason to do, that for years past I
had never known time pass on so happily; that in the peaceful calm we
lived, I had tasted a higher enjoyment than all the most buoyant pleasures
of healthier and younger days had ever given me. &ldquo;But,&rdquo;&mdash;I believe I
tried to smile as I spoke,&mdash;&ldquo;but recollect, Sir Gordon, I have got my
billet: the doctors have told me to go, and die, at Naples. What a shock
to science if I should remain, to live, at Como!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do so, my dearest friend,&rdquo; said he, grasping my hands within both of his,
while the tears swam in his eyes; &ldquo;I cannot&mdash;I dare not&mdash;I have
not strength to tell you, all that your compliance with this wish will
confer on me Spare me this anguish, and do not leave us.&rdquo; As he uttered
these words he left me, his emotion too great to let me reply.
</p>
<p>
The sick man&rsquo;s selfishness would say, that his anxiety is about that
wasting malady, whose ravages are even more plainly seen than felt.
</p>
<p>
Turn the matter over how I will, I cannot reconcile this eager anxiety for
my remaining with any thing but a care for myself. It is clear he thinks
me far worse than I can consent to acknowledge. I do not disguise from
myself the greater lassitude I experience after a slight exertion, a
higher tension of the nervous system, and an earlier access of that night
fever, which, like the darkness of the coming winter, creeps daily on,
shortening the hours of sunlight, and ushering in a deeper and more solemn
gloom; but I watch these symptoms as one already prepared for their
approach, and feel grateful that their coming has not clouded the serenity
with which I hope to journey to the last.
</p>
<p>
Kind old man! I would that I were his son, that I could feel my rightful
claim to the affection he lavishes on me; but for <i>his</i> sake it is
better as it is! And Miss Howard&mdash;Lucy, let me call her, since I am
permitted so to accost her&mdash;what a blessing I should have felt such a
sister to be, so beautiful, so kind, so gently feminine! for that is the
true charm. This, too, is better as it is. How could I take leave of life,
if I were parting with such enjoyments?
</p>
<p>
She is greatly changed since we came here. Every day seems to gain
something over the malady she laboured under. She is no longer faint and
easily wearied, but able to take even severe exercise without fatigue; her
cheek has grown fuller, and its rosy tint is no longer hectic, but the
true dye of health; and instead of that slow step and bent-down head, her
walk is firm and her air erect; while her spirits, no longer varying from
high excitement to deep depression, are uniformly good and animated. Life
is opening in all its bloom to her, as rapidly as its shadows are closing
and gathering around me. Were it mine to bestow, how gladly would I give
what remains of flickering life to strengthen the newly-sprung vitality,
her light step, her brilliant smile and dark blue eye! That coming back to
health, from out of the very shadow of death, must be a glorious
sensation! The sudden outbursting of all this fair world&rsquo;s joys, on a
spirit over which the shade of sickness has only swept, and not rested
long enough to leave its blight. I think I read in that almost heroic
elevation of sentiment, that exquisite perception of whatever is beautiful
in Lucy, the triumph of returning energy and health. She is less fanciful
and less capricious, too. Formerly, the least remark, in which she
construed a difference of opinion, would distress or irritate her, and her
temper appeared rather under the sway of momentary impulse than the
guidance of right principle. Now, she accepts even correction, mildly and
gratefully, and if a sudden spark of former haste flash forth, she seems
eager to check and repress it; she acts as though she felt that restored
health imposed more restraint and less of self-indulgence than sickness.
How happy if one were only to bring out of the sick chamber its teaching
of submission, patience, and gratitude, and leave behind its egotism and
its irritability! This she would appear to aim at; and to strive is to
win.
</p>
<p>
And now I quit this chronicling to join her. Already she is on her way to
the boat, and we are going to see Pliny&rsquo;s villa; at least the dark and
shadowy nook where it once stood. The lake is still as a mirror, and a
gorgeous mirror it is, reflecting a scene of faëry brilliancy and beauty.
She is waving her handkerchief to me to come. &ldquo;<i>Vengo, subito</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This has been a delightful day. We rowed along past Melzi till we came
under the tall cliffs near Bellagio; and there, in a little bay,
land-locked and shaded by olive-trees, we dined. I had never seen Sir
Gordon so thoroughly happy. When Lucy&rsquo;s spirits have been higher, and her
fancy has taken wilder and bolder wings, he has usually worn a look of
anxiety through all his admiring fondness. To-day, she was less animated
than she generally is&mdash;almost grave at times&mdash;but not sad; and I
think that &ldquo;Grandpapa&rdquo; loved her better in this tranquil mood, than in
those of more eager enjoyment. I believe I read his meaning, that, in her
highest flow of spirits, he dreads the wear and tear consequent on so much
excitement; while in her more sombre days he indulges the hope that she is
storing up in repose the energies of future exertion. How it takes off the
egotism of sickness to have some one whose ever-watchful care is busy for
our benefit! how it carries away the load of &ldquo;self,&rdquo; and all its troubles!
while I.... But I must not dwell on this theme, nor disturb that deep
sense of gratitude I feel for all that I possess of worldly advantage,
were it no more than this blessing, that on quitting life I leave it when
my sense of enjoyment has mellowed into that most lasting and enduring
one, the love of quiet, of scenery, of converse with old friends on
by-gone events&mdash;the tranquil pleasures of age tasted without the
repining of age!
</p>
<p>
Lucy bantered me to-day upon my inordinate love of ease, as she called it,
forgetting that this inactivity was at first less from choice than
compulsion; now, it is a habit, one I may as well wear out, for I have no
time left to acquire new ones. She even tried to stimulate my ambition, by
alluding to my old career and the rewards it might have opened to me. I
could have told her that a father or an uncle at the &ldquo;Council&rdquo; was of more
avail than a clever despatch or a well-concluded treaty; that some of our
ablest Ministers are wasting life and energy at small, obscure, and
insignificant missions, where their functions never rise beyond the
presentation of letters of congratulation or condolence, attendance on a
court ball, or a <i>Te Deum</i> for the sovereign&rsquo;s birthday; while
capacities that would be unnoticed, if they were not dangerous, have the
destinies of great events in their keeping. True, there is always the
Foreign Office as the &ldquo;<i>Cour d&rsquo;Appel</i>&rdquo; and, whatever may be the
objections&mdash;grave and weighty they certainly are at times&mdash;against
those parliamentary interrogations by which the Minister is compelled to
reveal the object and course of his dealings with foreign nations, there
is one admirable result,&mdash;our foreign policy will always be National.
No Minister can long pursue any course in defiance of the approval of
Parliament; nor can any Parliament, in our day, long resist the force of
public opinion.
</p>
<p>
While, therefore, Nicholas or Metternich may precipitate the nations they
rule over into a war, where there is neither the sympathy nor the
prejudices of a people involved, <i>we</i> never draw the sword without a
hearty good will to wield it.
</p>
<p>
To what end all this in reference to Lucy Howard&rsquo;s question? None
whatever; for, in truth, I was half flattered by the notion that the
shattered, storm-beaten wreck, could be supposed sea-worthy, and so I
promised amendment. How pleasant it was, sitting Tityrus-like, to dream
over high rewards and honours! She, at least, seemed to think so; for
whether to stimulate my ardour, or merely following the impulse of her
own, I know not, but she certainly dwelt with animation and delight on the
advantages of a career that placed one almost <i>au pied d&rsquo;égal</i> with
sovereigns. &ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that you cannot look upon those who
started in the race with yourself, without some repinings that others,
whom you know to be inferior to you, have passed you; and that men whom
you would never have thought of as competitors, are now become more than
equals.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
If I accede to this opinion to a certain extent, still I must protest
against any feeling of real regret when I think that success is much
oftener obtained by what is called a &ldquo;lucky hit,&rdquo; than by years of zealous
and intelligent exertion. I have known a man obtain credit for stopping a
courier&mdash;waylaying him, I might rather call it&mdash;and taking by
force a secret treaty from his hand, while the steady services of a
life-long have gone unrewarded. These things have an evil influence upon
diplomacy as a &ldquo;career;&rdquo; they suggest to young men to rely rather on
address and dexterity than upon &ldquo;prudence and forethought.&rdquo; Because Lord
Palmerston discourses foreign politics with a certain gifted and very
beautiful Countess, or that M. Guizot deigns to take counsel from a most
accomplished Princess of Russian origin, every small <i>Attaché</i> thinks
he is climbing the short road to fame and honours by listening to the <i>fadaise</i>
of certain political <i>boudoirs</i>, and hearing &ldquo;pretty ladies talk&rdquo;
 about Spielberg and Monkopf. When the Northern minister sent his son to
travel through the world, that he might see with his own eyes by what
&ldquo;commonplace mortals states were governed,&rdquo; he might have recommended to
his especial notice Plenipo&rsquo;s and Envoys Extraordinary. From time to time,
it is otherwise. Lord Castlereagh, whatever detraction party hate may
visit on his home politics, was a consummate Ambassador. Not of that
school which Talleyrand created, and of which he was the head, but a man
of unflinching courage, high determination, and who, with a strong purpose
and resolute will, never failed to make felt the influence of a nation he
so worthily represented. With this, he was a perfect courtier; the extreme
simplicity of his manner and address was accompanied by an elegance and a
style of the most marked distinction. Another, but of a different stamp,
was Lord Whitworth; one on whom all the dramatic passion and practised
outrage of Napoleon had no effect whatever.
</p>
<p>
Sir Gordon remarked, that in this quality of coolness and imperturbability
he never saw any one surpass his friend, Sir Robert Darcy. One evening
when playing at whist, at Potzdam, with the late King of Prussia, his
Majesty, in a fit of inadvertence, appropriated to himself several gold
pieces belonging to Sir Robert. The King at last perceived and apologised
for his mistake, adding, &ldquo;Why did you not inform me of it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Because I
knew your Majesty always makes restitution when you have obtained time for
reflection.&rdquo; Hanover was then on the <i>tapis</i>, and the King felt the
allusion. I must not forget a trait of that peculiar sarcastic humour for
which Sir Robert was famous. Although a Whig&mdash;an old blue-and-yellow
of the Fox school&mdash;he hated more than any man that mongrel party
which, under the name of Whigs, have carried on the Opposition in
Parliament for so many years; and of that party, a certain well-known
advocate for economical reforms came in for his most especial detestation:
perhaps he detested him particularly, because he had desecrated the high
ground of Oppositional attack, and brought it down to paltry cavillings
about the sums accorded to poor widows on the Pension List, or the amount
of sealing-wax consumed in the Foreign Office. When, therefore, the
honourable and learned gentleman, in the course of a continental tour,
happened to pass through the city where Sir Robert lived as ambassador, he
received a card of invitation to dinner, far more on account of a certain
missive from the Foreign Office, than from any personal claims he was
possessed of. The Member of Parliament was a <i>gourmand</i> of the first
water; he had often heard of Sir Robert&rsquo;s <i>cuisine</i>&mdash;various
travellers had told him that such a table could not be surpassed, and so,
although desirous of getting forward, he countermanded his horses, and
accepted the invitation.
</p>
<p>
Sir Robert, whose taste for good living was indisputable, no sooner read
the note acceding to his request than he called his <i>attachés</i>
together, and said, &ldquo;Gentlemen, you will have a very bad dinner to-day,
but I request you will all dine here, as I have a particular object in
expressing the wish.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Dinner-hour came; and after the usual ceremony the party were seated at
table, when a single soup appeared: this was followed by a dish of fish,
and then, without <i>entrée</i> or <i>hors d&rsquo;oevre</i>, came a boiled leg
of mutton, Sir Robert premising to his guest that it was to have no
successor: adding, &ldquo;You see, sir, what a poor entertainment I have
provided for you; but to this have the miserable economists in Parliament
brought us&mdash;next session may carry it further, and leave us without
even so much.&rdquo; Joseph was sold, and never forgot it since.
</p>
<p>
I saw, that while Sir Gordon and I discussed people and events in this
strain, Lucy became inattentive and pre-occupied by other thoughts; and on
charging her with being so, she laughingly remarked that Englishmen always
carry about with them the one range of topics; and whether they dine in
Grosvenor Square, or beneath an olive-tree in the Alps, the stream of the
table-talk is ever the same. &ldquo;Now a Frenchman,&rdquo; said she, gaily, &ldquo;had
uttered I cannot say how many flat sentimentalisme about the place we are
in; a German had mysticised to no end; and an Italian would have been
improvising about every thing, from the wire that restrained the champagne
cork to the woes of enchained Italy. Tell us a story, Mr. Templeton.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A story! What shall it be? A love story? a ghost story? a merry, or a sad
one?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Any of these you like, so that it be true. Tell me something that has
actually happened.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That is really telling a secret,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;for while truth can be, and
oftener is, stranger than fiction, it is so, rather from turning ordinary
materials to extraordinary uses&mdash;making of every-day people singular
instances of vice and virtue&mdash;than for any great peculiarity in the
catastrophes to which they contribute.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t believe in the notion of everyday people. I have a theory,
that what are so summarily disposed of in this fashion are just as highly
endowed with individualities as any others. Do you remember a beautiful
remark, made in the shape of a rebuke, that Scott one day gave his
daughter for saying that something was &lsquo;Vulgar?&rsquo; &lsquo;Do you know what is the
meaning of the word vulgar? It is only common; and nothing that is common,
except wickedness, can deserve to be spoken of in terms of contempt: and
when you have lived to my years, you will be disposed to agree with me in
thanking God that nothing really worth having or caring about in this
world is <i>uncommon</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;When I said ordinary, every-day people, don&rsquo;t mistake me; I meant only
those who, from class and condition, follow a peculiar ritual, and live
after a certain rubric of fashion; and who, hiding themselves under a
common garment, whose cut, colour, and mode are the same, are really
undistinguishable, save on great and trying occasions.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Kings, for instance! whom great diplomatic folks are supposed to see a
great deal of, and know in all the terms of an easy intimacy.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But how do we see them? In an armour of reserve and caution, never
assumed to any one else. The ease you speak of is all assumed. It is the
conventional politeness accorded to a certain station. Kings, so far as I
have seen, are never really engaging, save to a great minister out of
power. Then their manner assumes all its attractiveness; on the principle,
perhaps, that Curran paid his homage to the antique Hercules,&mdash;that
<i>his</i> day might yet come uppermost, and he would not forget the
friend who visited him in adversity.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, to come back, tell us a story. Let it be what you will, or of where
and whom you please, so that it last while we are rowing homeward.
Monologue is always better than conversation by moonlight.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But stay; what are the lights we see yonder, glancing from amid the
trees? And there, now, see the bright blaze that has sprung up, and is
reflected red and lurid on the lake below. It is a &lsquo;Festa&rsquo; of the Church;
for hear, the bells are ringing merrily from the mountain-top, and there
go the people in procession, climbing the steep path towards the summit.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Wonderful superstition! that has fashioned itself to every phase and form
of human nature&mdash;now, sending its aid to the darkest impulses of
passion, as we see in Ireland&mdash;now, conforming to the most simple
tastes of an unthinking people; for these peasants here are not imbued
with the piety of the Church&mdash;they only love its gauds. It is to the
Tyrol you must go to witness the real devotional feeling of a people.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, shall I tell you a story?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; I am weaving one, now, for myself!&rdquo;

<h2>
CHAPTER VI. <i>Villa Cimarosa, Lake of Como</i>
</h2>
<p>
Gilbert reminds me that I had arranged my departure hence for to-morrow:
this was some weeks back, and now I have no intention of leaving. I cling
to this &ldquo;Happy Valley,&rdquo; as one clings to life. To me it is indeed such.
These days of sunshine and nights of starry brilliancy&mdash;this calm,
delicious water&mdash;these purpled mountains, glowing with richer tints
as day wears on, till at sunset they are one blaze of gorgeous splendour,&mdash;the
very plash of those tiny waves upon the rocky shore are become to me like
friendly sights and sounds, from which I cannot tear myself. And Lucy,
too, she is to me as a sister, so full of kind, of watchful consideration
about me; since her own health is so much restored, all her anxiety would
seem for mine. How puzzling is the tone assumed by Sir Gordon towards me!
It was only yesterday that, in speaking of his granddaughter, he expressed
himself in such terms of gratitude to me for the improvement manifest in
her health, as though I had really been the main agent in effecting it. I,
whose power has never been greater than a heart-cherished wish that one so
fair, so beautiful, and so good, should live to grace and adorn the world
she moves in! What a strange race, what a hard-fought struggle, has been
going on within me for some time back! Ebbing life contesting with budding
affection; the calm aspect of coming death dashed by feelings and thoughts&mdash;ay,
even hopes I had believed long since at rest. I feel less that I love than
that I should love, if life were to be granted to me.
</p>
<p>
I believe it is the pursuit that in most cases suggests the passion; that
the effort we may make to win exalts the object we wish to gain. Not so
here, however. <i>If I do love</i>, it has been without any consciousness.
It is so seldom that one who has never had a sister learns to know, in
real intimacy, the whole heart and nature of a young and lovely girl, with
all its emotions of ever-changing hue, its thousand caprices, its
weakness, and its pride. To me this study&mdash;it has been a study&mdash;has
given an inexpressible interest to my life here. And then to watch how
gradually, almost imperceptibly to herself, the discipline of her mind has
been accomplished&mdash;checking wild flights of fancy here, restraining
rash impulses there, encouraging reflection, conquering prejudices,&mdash;all
these done without my bidding, and yet palpably through my influence; What
pleasant flattery!
</p>
<p>
One distressing thought never leaves me. It is this,&mdash;how will a
nature so attuned as hers stand the rude jars and discords of &ldquo;the world?&rdquo;
 for, do how we will, screen the object of affection how we may from its
shocks and concussions, the stern realities of life will make themselves
felt. Hers is too impassioned a nature to bear such reverses, as the most
even current sustains, without injury. The very consciousness of being
mistaken in our opinions of people is a sore lesson; it is the beginning
of scepticism, to end&mdash;who can tell where?
</p>
<p>
She smiles whenever I lecture her upon any eccentricity of manner, and
evidently deems my formalism, as she calls it, a relic of my early
teaching. So, perhaps, it may be. No class of people are so unforgiving to
any thing like a peculiarity as your <i>Diplomates</i>. They know the
value of the impassive bearing that reveals nothing, and they carry the
reserve of office into all the relations of private life. She even quizzes
me about this, and says that I remind her of the old Austrian envoy at
Naples, who never ventured upon any thing more explicit than the two
phrases&mdash;<i>C&rsquo;est dure</i>, or <i>C&rsquo;est sûre</i>, ringing the changes
of these upon every piece of news that reached him. How altered am I, if
this judgment be correct! I, that was headstrong even to rashness, led by
every impulse, precipitate in every thing, ready to resign all, and with
one chance my favour to dare nine full against me!
</p>
<p>
But why wonder if I be so changed? How has life and every living object
changed its aspect to my eyes, rendering distasteful a thousand things
wherein I once took pleasure, and making of others that I deemed flat,
stale, and unprofitable, the greatest charms of my existence? What close
and searching scrutiny of motives creeps on with years! what distrust, and
what suspicion! It is this same sentiment&mdash;the fruit of a hundred
self-deceptions and disappointments&mdash;makes so many men, as they
advance in life, abjure Liberalism in politics, and lean to the side of
Absolute Rule. The &ldquo;Practical&rdquo; exercises the only influence on the mind
tempered by long experience; and the glorious tyranny of St. Peter&rsquo;s is
infinitely preferable to the miscalled freedom of Popular Government. The
present Pope, however our Radical friends think of it, is no unworthy
successor of Hildebrand; and however plausible be the assumed reforms in
his States, the real thraldom, the great slavery, remains untouched!
&ldquo;Hands Free, Souls Fettered,&rdquo; is strange heraldry.
</p>
<p>
Why have these thoughts crept over me? I would rather dwell on very
different themes; but already, far over the mountains westward, comes the
distant sound of strife. The dark clouds that are hurrying over the lofty
summit of Monte Brisbone are wafted from regions where armed hosts are
gathering, and the cry of battle is heard; and Switzerland, whose
war-trophies have been won from the invader, is about to be torn by civil
strife. Even in my ride to-day towards Lugano, I met parties of peasants
armed, and wearing the cockade of Ticino in their hats, hastening towards
Capo di Lago. The spectacle was a sad one; the field labours of the year,
just begun, are already arrested; the plough is seen standing in the
unfinished furrow, and the team is away to share the fortunes of its
owners in the panoply of battle. These new-made soldiers, too, with all
the loutish indifference of the peasant in their air, have none of the
swaggering effrontery of regular troops, and consequently present more
palpably to the eye the sufferings of a population given up to
conscription and torn from their peaceful homes to scenes of carnage and
bloodshed, and for what?&mdash;for an opinion? for even less than an
opinion: for a suspicion&mdash;a mere doubt.
</p>
<p>
Who will be eager in this cause on either side? None, save those that
never are to mingle in the contest. The firebrand Journalist of Geneva&mdash;the
dark-intentioned Jesuit of Lucerne; these are they who will accept of no
quarter, nor listen to one cry of mercy: such, at least, is the present
aspect of the struggle. Lukewarmness, if not actual repugnance, among the
soldiery; hatred supplying all the enthusiasm of those who hound them on.
</p>
<p>
The Howards are already uneasy at their vicinity to the seat of war, and
speak of proceeding southward; yet they will not hear of my leaving them.
I feel spell-bound, not only to them but to the very place itself; a
presentiment is upon me, that, after this, life will have no pleasure left
for me&mdash;that I go hence to solitude, to suffering, and to death!
</p>
<p>
A restless night, neither waking nor sleeping, but passed in wild, strange
fancies, of reality and fiction commingled; and now, I am feverish and
ill. The struggle against failing health is at last become torture; for I
feel&mdash;alas that I must say it!&mdash;the longing desire to live.
Towards daybreak I did sleep, and soundly; but I dreamed too&mdash;and how
happily! I fancied that I was suddenly restored to health, with all the
light-heartedness and spring of former days, and returning with my bride
to Walcott.
</p>
<p>
We were driving rapidly up the approach, catching glimpses at times of the
old abbey&mdash;now a gable&mdash;now some richly traceried pinnacle&mdash;some
quaint old chimney&mdash;some trellised porch. She was wild with delight,
in ecstasy at the sylvan beauty of the scene: the dark and silent wood&mdash;the
brown, clear river, beside the road&mdash;the cooing note of the
wood-pigeon, all telling of our own rural England. &ldquo;Is not this better
than ambition, love?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Are not leafy groves, these moss-grown
paths, more peaceful than the high-roads of fame?&rdquo; I felt her hand grasp
mine more closely, and I awoke&mdash;awoke to know that I was dreaming&mdash;that
my happiness was but a vision&mdash;my future a mere mockery.
</p>
<p>
Why should not Lucy see these scenes? She will return well and in
strength. I would that she would dwell, sometimes, at least, among the
places I have loved so much. I have often thought of making her my heir. I
have none to claim from me&mdash;none who need it. There is one clause,
however, she might object to, nay, perhaps, would certainly refuse. My
grand-uncle&rsquo;s will makes it imperative that the property should always
descend to a Templeton.
</p>
<p>
What if she rejected the condition? It would fall heavily on me were she
to say &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I will speak to Sir Gordon about this. I must choose my time, however, and
do it gravely and considerately, that he may not treat it as a mere sick
man&rsquo;s fancy. Of course, I only intend that she should assume the name and
arms; but this branch of the Howards are strong about pedigree, and call
themselves older than the Norfolks.
</p>
<p>
So there is no time to be lost in execution of my plan. The Favancourts
are expected here to-morrow, on their way to Naples. The very thought of
their coming is misery to me. How I dread the <i>persiflage</i> of the
beauty &ldquo;<i>en vogue;</i>&rdquo; the heartless raillery that is warmed by no
genial trait; the spiritless levity that smacks neither of wit nor buoyant
youth, but is the mere coinage of the salons! How I dread, too, lest Lucy
should imitate her! she so prone to catch up a trait of manner, or a trick
of gesture! And Lady Blanche can make herself fascinating enough to be a
model. To hear once more the dull recital of that world&rsquo;s follies that I
have left, its endless round of tiresome vice, would be a heavy
infliction. Alas, that I should have gained no more by my experience than
to despise it! But stay&mdash;I see Sir Howard yonder, near the lake. Now
for my project!

<h2>
CHAPTER VII. <i>La Spezzia</i>
</h2>
<p>
Another month, or nearly so, has elapsed since last I opened this book;
and now, as I look back, I feel like a convict who has slept soundly
during the night before his doom, and passed in forgetful-ness the hours
he had vowed to thought and reflection. I was reading Victor Hugo&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Dernier Jour d&rsquo;un Condamné&rdquo; last evening, and falling asleep with it in
my hand, traced out in my dreams a strange analogy between my own fate and
that of the convicted felon. The seductions and attractions of life
crowding faster and faster round one as we near the gate of death&mdash;the
redoubled anxieties of friends, their kinder sympathies&mdash;how
delightful would these be if they did not suggest the wish to live! But,
alas! the sunbeam lights not only the road before us, but that we have
been travelling also, and one is so often tempted to look back and linger!
To understand this love of life, one must stand as I do now; and yet, who
would deem that one so lonely and so desolate, so friendless and alone,
would care to live? It is so, however: sorrow attaches us more strongly
than joy; and the world becomes dearer to us in affliction as violets give
out their sweetest odours when pressed.
</p>
<p>
Let me recall something of the last few weeks, and remember, if I can, why
and how I am here alone. My last written sentence was dated &ldquo;Como, the
29th October,&rdquo; and then comes a blank&mdash;now to fill it up.
</p>
<p>
Sir Gordon Howard was standing near the lake as I came up with him, nor
was he aware of my approach till I had my hand on his arm. Whether that I
had disturbed him in a moment of deep thought, or that something in my own
sad and sickly face impressed him, I know not, but he did not speak, and
merely drawing my arm within his own, we wandered along the waters edge.
We sauntered slowly on till we came to a little moss-house, with stone
benches, where, still in silence, we sat down. It belonged to the Villa
d&rsquo;Esté, and was one of those many little ornamental buildings that were
erected by that most unhappy Princess, whose broken heart would seem
inscribed on every tree and rock around.
</p>
<p>
To me the aspect of the spot, lovely as it is, has ever been associated
with deep gloom. I never could tread the walks, nor sit to gaze upon the
lake from chosen points of view, without my memory full of her who, in her
exile, pined and suffered there. I know nothing of her history, save what
all others know; I am neither defender nor apologist&mdash;too humble and
too weak for either. I would but utter one cry for mercy on a memory that
still is dearly cherished by the poor who dwelt around her, and by whom
she is yet beloved.
</p>
<p>
Whatever were Sir Gordon&rsquo;s thoughts, it was clear the few efforts he made
to converse were not in accordance with them. The rumours of disturbance
in Switzerland&mdash;the increasing watchfulness on the Lombard frontier&mdash;the
growing feeling of uncertainty where and how far this new discord might
extend&mdash;these he spoke of, but rather as it seemed to mask other
themes, than because they were uppermost in his mind.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We must think of leaving this,&rdquo; said he, after a brief pause. &ldquo;&lsquo;Where
to?&rsquo; is the question. How would Genoa agree with <i>you?</i>&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;With <i>me!</i> Let there be no question of <i>me</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nay, but there must,&rdquo; said he, eagerly. &ldquo;Remember, first of all, that we
are now independent of Climate, at least of all that this side of the Alps
possesses; and, secondly, bethink you that <i>you</i> are the pilot that
weathered the storm for us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Happily, then,&rdquo; said I, laughing, or endeavouring to laugh, &ldquo;I may sing,&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
‘The waves are laid, My duties paid.&rsquo;
I must seek out some harbour of refuge and be at rest.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
&ldquo;But with us, Templeton&mdash;always with us,&rdquo; said the old man,
affectionately.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Upon one condition, Sir Gordon&mdash;short of that I refuse.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I fear me, that in my anxiety to subdue a rising emotion I threw into
these words an accent of almost stern and obstinate resolution; for as he
replied, &ldquo;Name your condition,&rdquo; his own voice assumed a tone of cold
reserve.
</p>
<p>
It was full a minute before I could resume; not only was the subject one
that I dreaded to approach from fear of failure, but I felt that I had
already endangered my chance of success by the inopportune moment of its
introduction. Retreat was out of the question, and I went on. As much to
give myself time for a little forethought, as to provide myself with a
certain impulse for the coming effort, as leapers take a run before they
spring, I threw out a hasty sketch of the late events of my life before
leaving England, and the reasons that induced me to come abroad. &ldquo;I knew
well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;better far than all the skill of physicians could teach,
that no chance of recovery remained for me; Science had done its utmost:
the machine had, however, been wound up for the last time&mdash;its wheels
and springs would bear no more. Nothing remained, then, but to economise
the hours, and let them glide by with as little restriction as might be.
There was but one alloy to this plan&mdash;its selfishness; but when may a
man practise egotism so pardonably as when about to part with what
comprises it?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I came away from England, then, with that same sentiment that made the
condemned captain beg he might be bled to death rather than fall beneath
the axe. I would, if possible, have my last days and hours calm and
unruffled, even by fear&mdash;little dreaming how vain are all such
devices to cheat one&rsquo;s destiny, and that death is never so terrible as
when life becomes dear. Yes, my friend, such has been my fate; in the calm
happiness of home here&mdash;the first time I ever knew the word&rsquo;s true
meaning&mdash;I learned to wish for life, for days of that peaceful
happiness where the present is tempered by the past, and hope has fewer
checks, because it comes more chastened by experience. You little thought,
that in making my days thus blissful my sorrow to part with them would be
a heavy recompense.... Nay, hear me out; words of encouragement only
increase my misery&mdash;they give not hope, they only awaken fresh
feelings of affection, so soon to be cold for ever.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
How I approached the subject on which my heart was set I cannot now
remember&mdash;abruptly, I fear; imperfectly and dubiously I know: because
Sir Gordon, one of the most patient and forbearing of men, suddenly
interrupted me by a violent exclamation, &ldquo;Hold! stay! not a word more!
Templeton, this cannot be; once for all, never recur to this again!&rdquo;
 Shocked, almost terrified by the agitation in his looks, I was unable to
speak for some seconds; and while I saw that some misconception of my
meaning had occurred, yet, in the face of his prohibition, I could
scarcely dare an attempt to rectify it. While I remained thus in painful
uncertainty, he seemed, by a strong effort, to have subdued his emotion,
and at length said, &ldquo;Not even to you, my dear friend&mdash;to you, to whom
I owe the hope that has sustained me for many a day past, can I reveal the
secret source of this sorrow, nor say why what you propose is impossible.
I dreaded something like this&mdash;I foresaw how it might be; nay, my
selfishness was such that I rejoiced at it, for her sake. There&mdash;there,
I will not trust myself with more. Leave me, Templeton; whatever your
griefs, they are as nothing compared to mine.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I left him, and, hastening towards the lake side, soon lost myself in the
dark groves of chestnut and olive, the last words still ringing in my ears&mdash;&ldquo;Whatever
your griefs, they are as nothing compared to mine.&rdquo; Such complete
pre-occupation had his agitation and trouble over my mind, that it was
long ere I could attempt to recall how I had evoked this burst of passion,
and by what words I had stirred him so to address me. Suddenly the truth
flashed boldly out; I perceived the whole nature of the error. He had, in
fact, interrupted iny explanation at a point which made it seem that I was
seeking his grandaughter in marriage. Not waiting to hear me out, he
deemed the allusions to my name, my family arms, and my fortune, were
intended to convey a proposal to make her my wife. Alas! I needed no
longer to wonder at his repugnance, nor speculate further on the energy of
his refusal. How entertain such a thought for his poor child! It were,
indeed, to weave Cyprus with the garland of the Bride!
</p>
<p>
Impatient any longer to lie under the misconception&mdash;at heart,
perhaps, vexed to think how wrongfully he must have judged me when deeming
me capable of the thought&mdash;I hastened back to the Villa, determined
at once to rectify the error and make him hear me out, whatever pains the
interview should cost either.
</p>
<p>
On gaining the house I found that Sir Gordon had just driven from the
door. Miss Howard, who for two days had been indisposed, was still in her
room. Resolving, then, to make my explanation in writing, I went to my
room; on the table lay a letter addressed to me, the writing of which was
scarcely dry. It ran thus:&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;My dearest Friend,

&ldquo;If I, in part, foresaw the possibility of what your words
to-day assured me, and yet did not guard against the hazard,
the sad circumstances of my lot in life are all I can plead
in my favour. I have never ceased to reproach myself that I
had not been candid and open with you at first, when our
intimacy was fresh. Afterwards, as it became friendship, the
avowal was impossible. I must not trust myself with more. I
have gone from home for a day or two, that when we meet
again the immediate memory of our last interview should have
been softened.    Be to me&mdash;to her, also&mdash;as though the
words were never spoken;  nor withdraw any portion of your
affection from those you have rescued from the greatest of
all calamities.

&ldquo;Yours ever,

&ldquo;Gordon Howard.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
The mystery grew darker and more impenetrable; harassing, maddening
suspicions, mixed themselves up in my brain, with thoughts too terrible
for endurance. I saw that, in Sir Gordon&rsquo;s error as to my intentions, he
had unwittingly disclosed the existence of a secret&mdash;a secret whose
meaning seemed fraught with dreadful import; that he would never have
touched upon this mysterious theme, save under the false impression my
attempted proposal had induced, was clear enough; and, that thus I had
unwittingly wrung from him an avowal which, under other circumstances, he
had never been induced to make.
</p>
<p>
I set about to think over every word I had used in our last interview&mdash;each
expression I had employed, torturing the simplest phrases by
interpretations the most remote and unlikely, that thereby some clue
should present itself to this mystery: but, charge my memory how I could,
reflect and ponder as I might, the words of his letter had a character of
more deep and serious meaning than a mere refusal of my proposition, taken
in what sense it might, could be supposed to call for. At moments,
thoughts would flash across my brain so terrible in their import, that had
they dwelt longer I must have gone mad. They were like sudden paroxysms of
some agonising disease, coming and recurring at intervals. Just as one of
these had left me, weak, worn out, and exhausted, a carriage, drawn by
four post-horses, drew up to the door of the Villa, and the instant after
my servant knocked at my door, saying, &ldquo;La Comtesse de Favancourt is
arrived, sir, and wishes to see you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Who was there whose presence I would not rather have faced?&mdash;that gay
and heartless woman of fashion, whose eyes, long practised to read a
history in each face, would soon detect in my agitated looks that
&ldquo;something had occurred,&rdquo; nor cease till she had discovered it. In Sir
Gordon&rsquo;s absence, and as Lucy was still indisposed, I had no alternative
but to receive her.
</p>
<p>
Scarcely had I entered the drawing-room than my worst fears were realised.
She was seated in an arm-chair, and lay back as if fatigued by her
journey; but on seeing me, without waiting to return my greeting of
welcome, she asked, abruptly,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Sir Gordon?&mdash;where&rsquo;s Miss Howard? Haven&rsquo;t they been
expecting me?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I answered, that Sir Gordon had gone over to the Brianza for a day; that
Miss Howard had been confined to her room, but, I was certain, had only to
learn her arrival to dress and come down to her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is this said <i>de bonne foi?</i>&rdquo; said she, with a smile where the
expression was far more of severity than sweetness. &ldquo;Are you treating me
candidly, Mr. Templeton? or is this merely another exercise of your old
functions as Diplomatist?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I started, partly from actual amazement, partly from a feeling of
indignant shame, at the accusation; but, recovering at once, assured her
calmly and respectfully that all I had said was the simple fact, without
the slightest shade of equivocation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; said she gaily; &ldquo;for I own to you I was beginning to
suspect our worthy friends of other motives. You know what a tiresome
world of puritanism and mock propriety we live in, and I was actually
disposed to fear that these dear souls had got up both the absence and the
illness not to receive me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not to receive you! Impossible!&rdquo; said I, with unfeigned astonishment.
&ldquo;The Howards, whom I have always reckoned as your oldest and most intimate
friends&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes! very old friends, certainly: but remember that these are exactly
the kind of people who take upon them to be severer than all the rest of
the world, and are ten times as rigid and unforgiving as one&rsquo;s enemies.
Now, as I could not possibly know how this affair might have been told to
them&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What affair? I&rsquo;m really quite in the dark to what you allude.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I mean my separation from Favancourt.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you separated from your husband, Lady Blanche?&rdquo; asked I, in a state
of agitation in strong contrast to her calm and quiet manner.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What a question, when all the papers have been discussing it these three
weeks! And from an old admirer, too! Shame on you, Mr. Templeton!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I know not how it was, but the levity of this speech, given as it was,
made my cheek flush till it actually seemed to burn.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nay, nay, I didn&rsquo;t mean you to blush so deeply,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;And what a
dear, sweet, innocent kind of life you must have been leading here, on
this romantic lake, to be capable of such soft emotions! Oh, dear!&rdquo; sighed
she, weariedly. &ldquo;You men have an immense advantage in your affairs of the
heart; you can always begin as freshly with each new affection, and be as
youthful in sentiment with each new love, as we are with our only passion.
Now I see it all; you have been getting up a &lsquo;<i>tendre</i>&rsquo; here for
somebody or other:&mdash;not Taglioni, I hope, for I see that is her Villa
yonder,&mdash;There, don&rsquo;t look indignant. This same Lake of Como has long
been known to be the paradise of <i>danseuses</i> and opera-singers; and I
thought it possible you might have dramatised a little love-story to
favour the illusion. Well, well,&rdquo; said she, sighing, &ldquo;so that you have not
fallen in love with poor Lucy Howard&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And why not with her?&rdquo; said I, starting, while in my quick-beating heart
and burning temples a sense of torturing pain went through me.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why not with her?&rdquo; reiterated she, pausing at each word, and fixing her
eyes steadfastly on me, with a look where no affected astonishment
existed; &ldquo;why not with her?&mdash;did you say this?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I did; and do ask, What is there to make it strange that one like her
should inspire the deepest sentiment of devotion, even from one whose days
are so surely numbered as mine are&mdash;so unworthy to hope&mdash;to win
her?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then you really are unaware! Well, I must say this was not treating you
fairly. I thought every one knew it, however; and I conclude they
themselves reasoned in the same way. Come, I suppose I must explain;
though, from your terrified face and staring eyeballs, I wish the task had
devolved on some other. Be calm and collected, or I shall never venture
upon it.&mdash;Well, poor dear Lucy inherits her mother&rsquo;s malady&mdash;she
is insane!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Broken half-words, stray fragments of speech, met my ears, for she went on
to talk of the terrible theme with the volubility of one who revelled in a
story of such thrilling horror. I, however, neither heard nor remembered
more; passages of well-remembered interest flashed upon my mind, but, like
scenes lit up by some lurid light, glowed with meanings too direful to
dwell on.
</p>
<p>
How I parted from her&mdash;how I left the Villa and came hither,
travelling day and night, till exhausted strength could bear no more&mdash;are
still memories too faint to recall; the realities of these last few days
have less vividness than my own burning, wasting thoughts: nor can I, by
any effort, separate the terrible recital she gave from my own reflections
upon it.
</p>
<p>
I must never recur to this again&mdash;nor will I reopen the page whereon
it is written: I have written this to test my own powers of mind, lest I
too&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Shakspeare, who knew the heart as none, save the inspired, have ever known
it, makes it the test of sanity to recall the events of a story in the
same precise order, time after time, neither changing nor inverting them.
This is Lear&rsquo;s reply to the accusation of madness, when yet his
intelligence was unclouded,&mdash;&ldquo;I will the matter re-word, which
madness would gabble from.&rdquo;

<h2>
CHAPTER VIII. <i>Lerici, Gulf of Spezzia</i>
</h2>
<p>
Another night of fever! The sea, beating heavily upon the rocks, prevented
sleep; or worse&mdash;filled it with images of shipwreck and storm. I sat
till nigh midnight on the terrace&mdash;poor Shelley&rsquo;s favourite
resting-place&mdash;watching the night as it fell, at first in gloomy
darkness, and then bright and starlit. There was no moon, but the planets,
reflected in the calm sea, were seen like tall pillars of reddish light;
and although all the details of the scenery were in shadow, the bold
outlines of the distant Apennines, and of the Ponto Venere and the Island
of Palmaria, were all distinctly marked out. The tall masts and taper
spars of the French fleet at anchor in the bay were also seen against the
sky, and the lurid glow of the fires spangled the surface of the sea.
Strange chaos of thought was mine! At one moment, Lord Byron was before
me, as, seated on the taffrail of the &ldquo;Bolivar,&rdquo; with all canvass
stretched, he plunged through the blue waters; his fair brown hair
spray-washed and floating back with the breeze; his lip curled with the
smile of insolent defiance; and his voice ringing with the music of his
own glorious verse. Towards midnight the weather suddenly changed; to the
total stillness succeeded a low but distant moaning sound, which came
nearer and nearer, and at last a &ldquo;Levanter,&rdquo; in all its fury, broke over
the sea, and rolled the mad waves in masses towards the shore. I have seen
a storm in the Bay of Biscay, and I have witnessed a &ldquo;whole gale&rdquo; off the
coast of Labrador, but for suddenness, and for the wild tumult of sea and
wind commingled, I never saw any thing like this. Not in huge rolling
mountains, as in the Atlantic, did the waves move along, but in short,
abrupt jets, as though impelled by some force beneath; now, skimming each
over each, and now, spiriting up into the air, they threw foam and spray
around them like gigantic fountains. As abruptly as the storm began, so
did it cease; and as the wind fell, the waves moved more and more
sluggishly; and in a space of time inconceivably brief, nothing remained
of the hurricane save the short plash of the breakers, and at intervals
some one, long, thundering roar, as a heavier mass threw its weight upon
the strand. It was just then, ere the sea had resumed its former calm, and
while still warring with the effects of the gale, I thought I saw a boat
lying keel uppermost in the water, and a man grasping with all the energy
of despair to catch the slippery planks, which rose and sank with every
motion of the tide. Though apparently far out at sea, all was palpable and
distinct to my eyes as if happening close to where I sat. A grey darkness
was around, and yet at one moment&mdash;so brief as to be uncountable&mdash;I
could mark his features, beautifully handsome and calm even in his
drowning agony; at least so did their wan and wearied expression strike
me. Poor Shelley! I fancied you were before me; and, long after the vision
passed away, a faint, low cry, continued to ring in my ears&mdash;the last
effort of the voice about to be hushed for ever. Then the whole picture
changed, and I beheld the French fleet all illuminated, as if for a
victory; the decks and yards crowded with seamen, and echoing with their
triumphant cheers; while on the poop-deck of the &ldquo;Souverain&rdquo; stood a pale
and sickly youth, thoughtful and sad, his admiral&rsquo;s uniform carelessly
half-buttoned, and his unbelted sword carried negligently in his hand.
This was the Prince de Joinville, as I had seen him the day before, when
visiting the fleet. I could not frame to my mind where and over whom the
victory was won; but disturbed fears for our own naval supremacy flitted
constantly across me, and every word I had heard from the French captain
who had accompanied me in my visit kept sounding in my ears: as, for
instance, while exhibiting the Paixhan&rsquo;s cannons, he added,&mdash;&ldquo;Now,
here is an arm your ships have not acquired.&rdquo; Such impressions must have
gone deeper than, at the time, I knew of, for they made the substance of a
long and painful dream; and when, awaking suddenly, the first object I
beheld was the French fleet resting still and tranquil in the bay, my
heart expanded with a sense of relief unspeakably delightful.
</p>
<p>
So, then, I must hence. These Levanters usually continue ten or twelve
days, and then are followed by the Tramontana, as is called the wind from
the Apennines; and this same Tramontana is all but fatal to those as weak
as I am. How puzzling&mdash;I had almost said, how impossible&mdash;to
know any thing about climate! and how invariably, on this as on most other
subjects, mere words usurp the place of ideas! It is enough to say
&ldquo;Italy,&rdquo; to suggest hope to the consumptive man; and yet, what severe
trials does this same boasted climate involve! These scorching autumnal
suns; and cold, cutting breezes, wherever shade is found;&mdash;the genial
warmth of summer, here; and yonder, in that alley, the piercing air of
winter;&mdash;vicissitudes that wake up the extremes of every climate,
occur each twenty-four hours. And he, whose frail system can barely
sustain the slightest shock, must now learn to accommodate itself to
atmospheres of every density; now vapour charged and heavy, now oxygenated
to a point of stimulation that, even in health, would be felt as
over-exciting.
</p>
<p>
There is something of the same kind experienced here intellectually: the
every-day tone of society is trifling and frivolous to a degree; the
topics discussed are of a character which, to our practical notions, never
rise above mere levity; and even where others of a deeper interest are
introduced, the mode of treating them is superficial and meagre. Yet,
every now and then, one meets with some high and great intelligence, some
man of wide reflection and deep research; and then, when hearing the words
of wisdom in that glorious language, which unites Teutonic vigour with
every Gallic elegance, you feel what a people this might be who have such
an interpreter for their thoughts and deeds. In this way I remember
feeling when first I heard Italian from the lips of a truly great and
eloquent speaker. He was a small old man, slightly bowed in the shoulders&mdash;merely
enough so to exhibit to more advantage the greater elevation of a noble
head, which rose like the dome of a grand cathedral; his forehead, wide
and projecting over the brows which were heavy, and would have been almost
severe in their meaning, save for the softened expression of his large
brown eyes; his hair, originally-black, was now grey, but thick and
massive, and hang in locky folds, like the antique, on his neck and
shoulders. In manner he was simple, quiet, and retiring, avoiding
observation, and seeking rather companionship with those whose unobtrusive
habits made them unlikely for peculiar notice. When I met him he was in
exile. Indeed I am not certain if the ban of his offence be recalled;
whether or not, the voice of all Italy now invokes his return, and the
name of Gioberti is associated with the highest and the noblest views of
national freedom.
</p>
<p>
Well, indeed, were it for the cause of Italy if her progress were to be
entrusted to men like this&mdash;if the great principles of reform were to
be committed to intelligences capable of weighing difficulties, avoiding
and accommodating dangers. So late as the day before last I had an
opportunity of seeing a case in point. It is but a few weeks since the
good people of Lucca, filled with new wine and bright notions of liberty,
compelled their sovereign to abdicate. There is no denying that he had no
other course open to him; for if the Grand Duke of Tuscany could venture
to accord popular privileges, supported as he was by a very strong body of
nobles, whose possessions will always assure them a great interest in the
state, the little kingdom of Lucca had few, if any, such securities. Its
sovereign must either rule or be ruled. Now, he had not energy of
character for the one&mdash;he did not like the other. Austria refused to
aid him&mdash;not wishing, probably, to add to the complication of
Ferrara; and so he abdicated. Now comes <i>le commencement du fin</i>. The
Luccese gained the day: they expelled the Duke&mdash;they organised a
national guard&mdash;they illuminated&mdash;they protested, cockaded, and&mdash;are
ruined! Without trade, or any of its resources, this little capital, like
almost all those of the German duchies, lived upon &ldquo;the Court.&rdquo; The
sovereign was not only the fount of honour, but of wealth! Through his
household flowed the only channel by which industry was nurtured: it was
his court and his dependants whose wants employed the active heads and
hands of the entire city. The Duke is gone&mdash;the palace closed&mdash;the
courtyard even already half grass-grown! Not an equipage is to be heard or
seen; not even a footman in a court livery rides past; and all the
recompense for this is the newly conferred privileges of liberty, to a
people who recognise in freedom, not a new bond of obligation, but an
unbridled license of action. The spirit of our times is, however, against
this. The inspired grocers, who form the Guardia Civica, are our only
guides now; it will be curious enough to see where they will lead us.
</p>
<p>
When thinking of Italian liberty, or Unity, for that is the phrase in
vogue, I am often reminded of the Irish priest who was supposed by his
parishioners to possess an unlimited sway over the seasons, and who, when
hard-pushed to exercise it, at last declared his readiness to procure any
kind of weather that three farmers would agree upon, well knowing, the
while, how diversity of interest must for ever prevent a common demand.
This is precisely the case. An Italian kingdom to comprise the whole
Peninsula would be impossible. The Lombards have no interests in common
with the Neapolitans. Venice is less the sister than the rival of Genoa.
How would the haughty Milanese, rich in every thing that constitutes
wealth, surrender their station to the men of the South, whom they despise
and look down upon? None would consent to become Provincial; and even the
smallest states would stand up for the prerogative of separate identity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A National&rdquo; Guard slowly paces before the gate, within which Royalty no
longer dwells; and the banner of their independence floats over their
indigence! Truly, they have torn up their mantle to make a cap of Liberty,
and they must bear the cold how they may!
</p>
<p>
As for the Duke himself, I believe he deserves the epithet I heard a
Frenchman bestow upon him&mdash;he is a <i>Pauvre Sire!</i> There is a
fatal consistency, certainly, about the conduct of these Bourbon Princes
in moments of trying emergency! They never will recognise danger till too
late to avert it. The Prince of Lucca, like Charles Dix, laughed at
popular menace, and yet had barely time to escape from popular vengeance.
There was a Ball at the palace on the very night when the tumult attained
its greatest importance; frequent messages were sent by the Ministers, and
more than one order to the troops given during the progress of the
entertainment. A despatch was opened at the supper-table; and as the Crown
Prince led out his fair partner&mdash;an English beauty, by-the-by&mdash;to
the <i>cotillon</i>, he whispered in her ear, &ldquo;We must keep it up late,
for I fancy we shall never have another dance in this <i>salle!</i>&rdquo; And
this is the way Princes can take leave of their inheritance; and so it is,
the &ldquo;divine right&rdquo; can be understood by certain &ldquo;Rulers of the people.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
If the defence of Monarchy depended on the lives and characters of
monarchs, how few could resist Republicanism! though, perhaps, every thing
considered, there is no station in life where the same number of good and
graceful qualities is so certain to win men&rsquo;s favour and regard. Maginn
used to say, that we &ldquo;admire wit in a woman as we admire a few words
spoken plain by a parrot.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The speech was certainly not a very gallant one; but I half suspect that
our admiration of royal attainments is founded upon a similar principle.
</p>
<p>
Kings can rarely be good talkers, because they have not gone through the
great training-school of talk&mdash;which is, conversation. This is
impossible where there is no equality; and how often does it occur to
monarchs to meet each other, and when they do, what a stilted, unreal
thing, must be their intercourse! Of reigning sovereigns, the King of
Prussia is perhaps the most gifted in this way; of course, less endowed
with that shrewd appreciation of character, that intuitive perception of
every man&rsquo;s bias, which marks the Monarch of the Tuileries, but possessed
of other and very different qualities, and with one especially which never
can be overvalued&mdash;an earnest sincerity of purpose in every thing.
There is no escaping from the conviction, that here is a man who reflects
and wills, and whose appeal to conscience is the daily rule of life. The
Nationality of Germany is his great object, and for it he labours as
strenuously&mdash;may it be as successfully!&mdash;as ever his &ldquo;Great&rdquo;
 predecessor did to accomplish the opposite. What a country would it be if
the same spirit of nationality were to prevail from the Baltic to the
Black Sea, and &ldquo;Germany&rdquo; have a political signification as well as a
geographical one!
</p>
<p>
After all, if we have outlived the age of heroic monarchy, we have happily
escaped that of royal débauchés. A celebrated Civil Engineer of our day is
reported to have said, in his examination before a parliamentary
committee, that he regarded &ldquo;rivers as intended by Providence to supply
navigable canals;&rdquo; in the same spirit one might opine certain characters
of royalty were created to supply materials for Vaudevilles.
</p>
<p>
What would become of the minor theatres of Paris if Louis XIV., and
Richelieu, and the Regency were to be interdicted? On whose memory dare
they hang so much of shameless vice and iniquitous folly? Where find
characters so degraded, so picturesque, so abandoned, so infamous, and so
amusing? What time and trouble, too, are saved by the adoption of this
era! No need of wearisome explanations and biographical details of the <i>dramatis
persono</i>. When one reads the word &ldquo;Marquis,&rdquo; he knows it means a man
whose whole aim in life is seduction; while &ldquo;Madame la Marquise&rdquo; is as
invariably the easy victim of royal artifice.
</p>
<p>
It might open a very curious view into the distinctive nature of national
character to compare the recognised class to which vice is attributed in
different countries; for while in England we select the aristocracy
always, as the natural subjects for depravity, in the Piedmontese
territory all the stage villains are derived from the mercantile world.
Instead of a Lord, as with us, the seducer is always a Manufacturer or a
Shipowner; and <i>vice</i> a Captain of Dragoons, their terror of domestic
peace, is a Cotton-spinner or a Dealer in Hardware.
</p>
<p>
Let it not be supposed that this originates in any real depravity, or any
actual want of honesty, in the mercantile world. No! the whole is
attributable to the &ldquo;Censor.&rdquo; By <i>his</i> arbitrary dictate the entire
of a piece is often re-cast, and so habituated have authors become to the
prevailing taste, that they now never think of occasioning him the trouble
of the correction. Tradesman there stands for scoundrel, as implicitly as
with us an Irishman is a blunderer and a Scotchman a knave. Exercised as
this power is, and committed to such hands as we find it in foreign
countries, it is hard to conceive any more quiet but effectual agent for
the degradation of a national taste. It is but a few weeks back I saw a
drama marked for stage representation in a city of Lombardy, in which the
words &ldquo;Pope&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cardinal&rdquo; were struck out as irreverent to utter; but
all the appeals&mdash;and most impious they were&mdash;to the Deity were
suffered to remain unmutilated.
</p>
<p>
And now I am reminded of rather a good theme for one of those little
dramatic pieces which amuse the public of the Palais Royal and the
Variétés. I chanced upon it in an old French book, called &ldquo;Mémoires et
Souvenirs de Jules Auguste Prévost, premier Valet de Charge de S. A. le
Duc de Courcelles.&rdquo; Printed at the Hague, anno 1742.
</p>
<p>
I am somewhat sceptical about the veraciousness of many of M. Prévost&rsquo;s
recitals; the greater number are, indeed, little else than chronicles of
his losses at <i>Ombre</i>, with a certain Mdlle. Valencay, or narratives
of &ldquo;<i>petits soupers</i>,&rdquo; where his puce-coloured shorts and coat of
ambre velvet were the chief things worthy of remembrance. Yet here and
there are little traits that look like facts, too insignificant for
fiction, and preserving something of the character of the time to which
they are linked. The whole bears no trace of ever having been intended for
publication; and it is not difficult to see where the new touches have
been laid on over the original picture. It was in all probability a mere
commonplace book, in which certain circumstances of daily life got mixed
up with the written details of his station in the Duke&rsquo;s household.
</p>
<p>
Neither its authenticity nor correctness, however, are of any moment to my
purpose, which was to jot down&mdash;from memory if I can,&mdash;the
subject I believe to be invested with dramatic material.
</p>
<p>
M. Prévost&rsquo;s narrative is very brief; indeed it barely extends beyond a
full allusion to a circumstance very generally known at the time. The
events run somewhat thus, or at least should do so, in the piece. At the
close of a brilliant fête at Versailles, where every fascination that an
age of unbounded luxury could procure was assembled, the King retired to
his apartment, followed by that prince of vaudeville characters, the
Maréchal Richelieu. His Majesty was wearied and out of spirits; the
pleasures of the evening, so far from having, as usual, elevated his
spirits and awakened his brilliancy, had depressed and fatigued him. He
was tired of the unvarying repetition of what his heart had long ceased to
have any share in; and, in fact, to use the vulgar, but most fitting
phrase, he was bored!
</p>
<p>
Bored by the courtiers, whose wit was too prompt to have been unprepared;
by the homage, too servile to have any sincerity; by the smiles of beauty,
perverted as they were by jealous rivalry and subtle intrigue; and, above
all, bored by the consciousness that he had no other identity than such as
kingly trappings gave him, and that all the love and admiration he
received were accorded to the monarch and nothing to the man.
</p>
<p>
He didn&rsquo;t exactly, as novel writers would say, pour his sufferings into
Richelieu&rsquo;s ear, but in very abrupt and forcible expressions he manifested
his utter weariness of the whole scene, and avowed a very firm belief that
the company was almost as tired of him as he was of the company.
</p>
<p>
In vain the Maréchal rallies his Majesty upon successes which were wont to
be called triumphs; in vain he assures him, that never at any period was
the domestic peace of the lieges more endangered by his Majesty&rsquo;s
condescensions: in fact, for once&mdash;as will happen, even with Kings
now and then&mdash;he said truth; and truth, however wholesome, is not
always palatable. Richelieu was too subtle an adversary to be easily
worsted; and after a fruitless effort to obliterate the gloomy impression
of the king, he, with a ready assurance, takes him in flank, and coolly
attributes the royal dissatisfaction to the very natural weariness at ever
seeing the same faces, however beautiful, and hearing the same voices,
however gay and sparkling their wit.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your Majesty will not give yourself the credit due of winning these
evidences of devotion from personal causes, rather than from adventitious
ones. Happily, a good opportunity presents itself for the proof. Your
Majesty may have heard of Madame de Vaugirarde, whose husband was killed
at La Rochelle?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The pretty widow who refuses to come to court?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The same, sire. She continues to reside at the antique château of her
late husband, alone, and without companionship; and, if report speak
truly, the brightest eyes of France are wasting their brilliancy in that
obscure retreat.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, what is to be done? You would not, surely, order her up to
Versailles by a &lsquo;<i>lettre de cachet?</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, sire, the measure were too bold; nay, perhaps my counsel will appear
far bolder: it is, that since Madame de Vaugirarde will not come to court,
your Majesty should go to Madame de Vaugirarde.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It was not very difficult to make this notion agreeable to the king. It
had one ingredient pleasurable enough to secure its good reception&mdash;it
was new&mdash;nobody had ever before dreamt of his Majesty making a tour
into the provinces <i>incog.</i> This was quite sufficient; and Richelieu
had scarcely detailed his intentions than the King burned with impatience
to begin his journey. The wily minister, however, had many things to
arrange before they set out; but of what nature he did not reveal to his
master. Certain is it that he left for Paris within an hour, hastening to
the capital with all the speed of post-horses. Arrived there, he exchanged
his court suit for a plain dress, and in a <i>fiacre</i> drove to the
private entrance of the Théâtre Français.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is M. Duroset engaged?&rdquo; said he, descending from the carriage.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He is on the stage, monsieur,&rdquo; said the porter, who took the stranger for
one of the better <i>bourgeois</i> of Paris, coming to secure a good <i>loge</i>
by personal intercession with the manager. Now, M. Duroset was at the very
moment occupied in the not very uncommon task of giving a poor actor his
<i>congé</i> who had just presented himself for an engagement.
</p>
<p>
As was the case in those days&mdash;(we have changed since then)&mdash;the
Director, not merely content with declining the proffered services, was
actually adding some very caustic remarks on the pretension of the
applicant, whose miserable appearance and ragged costume might have
claimed exemption from his gratuitous lecture.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Believe me, <i>mon cher</i>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a man must have a very different
air and carriage from yours who plays &lsquo;Le Marquis&rsquo; on the Parisian boards.
There should be something of the style and bearing of the world about him&mdash;his
address should be easy, without presumption&mdash;his presence commanding,
without severity.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I always played the noble parts in the provinces. I acted the &lsquo;Régent&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt of it; and very pretty notions of royalty the audience must
have gained from you. There, that will do. Go back to Nancy, and try
yourself at valets&rsquo; parts for a year or two&mdash;that&rsquo;s the best counsel
I can give you! Adieu! adieu!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The poor actor retired, discomfited and distressed, at the same instant
that the graceful figure of Richelieu advanced in easy dignity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Monsieur Duroset,&rdquo; said the Maréchal, seating himself, and speaking in
the voice so habituated to utter commands, &ldquo;I would speak a few words with
you in confidence, and where we might be certain of not being overheard.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nothing could be better than the present spot, then,&rdquo; said the manager,
who was impressed by the style and bearing of his visitor, without ever
guessing or suspecting his real rank. &ldquo;The rehearsal will not begin for
half-an-hour. Except that poor devil that has just left me, no one has
entered this morning.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sit down, then, and pay attention to what I shall say,&rdquo; said the
Maréchal. The words were felt as a command, and instantly obeyed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They tell me, M. Duroset, that a young actress, of great beauty and
distinguished ability, is about to appear on these boards, whose triumphs
have been hitherto won only in the provinces. Well, you must defer her <i>début</i>
for some days; and meanwhile, for the benefit of her health, she can make
a little excursion to the neighbourhood of Fontainebleau, where, at a
short distance from the royal forest, stands a small château. This will be
ready for her reception; and where a more critical taste than even your
audiences boast will decide upon her merits.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is but one man in France could make such a proposition!&rdquo; said the
manager, starting back, half in amazement, half in respect.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And I am exactly that man,&rdquo; rejoined the Maréchal. &ldquo;There need never be
secrets between men of sense. M. Duroset, the case is this: your beauty,
whose manners and breeding I conjecture to be equal to her charms, must
represent the character of the widowed Countess of Vaugirarde, whose
sorrow for her late husband is all but inconsolable. The solitude of her
retreat will, however, be disturbed by the accidental arrival of a
stranger, who, accompanied by his friend, will demand the hospitality of
the château. Grief has not usurped every faculty and <i>devoir</i> of the
fair Countess, who consents the following morning to receive the
respectful homage of the travellers, and even invites them, weary as they
seem by travel, to stay another day.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I understand&mdash;I understand,&rdquo; said Duroset, hastily interrupting this
narrative, which the speaker poured forth with impetuous rapidity; &ldquo;but
there are several objections, and grave ones.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain of it,&rdquo; rejoined the other; &ldquo;and now to combat them. Here are
a thousand louis; five hundred of which M. Duroset will keep&mdash;the
remainder he will expend, as his taste and judgment may dictate, in the
costume of the fair Countess.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But Mademoiselle Bellechasse?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Will accept of these diamonds, which will become her to perfection. She
is not a <i>blonde?</i>&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; dark hair and eyes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;This suite of pearls, then, will form a most graceful addition to her
toilette.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They are magnificent!&rdquo; exclaimed the manager, who, with wondering eyes,
turned from one jewel-case to the other; &ldquo;they are splendid! Nay&rdquo;&mdash;then
he added, in a lower accent, and with a glance, as he spoke, of inveterate
cunning&mdash;&ldquo;nay, they are a Princely present.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, M. Duroset, <i>un homme d&rsquo;esprit</i> is always so easy to treat with!
Might I dare to ask if Mademoiselle Bellechasse is here?&mdash;if I might
be permitted to pay my respects?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Certainly; your Excell&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nay, nay, M. Duroset, we are all incog.&rdquo; said the Maréchal, smiling
good-humouredly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;As you please, sir. I will go and make a brief explanation to
Mademoiselle, if you will excuse my leaving you. May I take these jewels
with me? Thanks.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The explanation was, indeed, of the briefest; and he returned in a few
seconds, accompanied by a young lady, whose elegance of mien and
loveliness of form seemed to astonish even the critical gaze of Richelieu.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Madame la Comtesse de Vaugirarde,&rdquo; said the Director, presenting her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Ah, belle Comtesse!</i>&rdquo; said the Maréchal, as he kissed the tips of
her fingers with the most profound courtesy; &ldquo;may I hope that the world
has still charms to win back one whose griefs should fall like spring
showers, and only render more fragrant the soil they water!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I know not what the future may bring forth,&rdquo; said she, with a most
gracefully-affected sadness; &ldquo;but for the present, I feel as if the
solitude of my ancient château, the peaceful quiet of the country, would
best respond to my wishes: there alone, to wander in those woods, whose
paths are endeared to me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Admirable!&mdash;beautiful!&mdash;perfect!&rdquo; exclaimed Richelieu, in a
transport of delight; &ldquo;never was the tribute of affection more touching&mdash;never
a more graceful homage rendered to past happiness! Now, when can you set
out?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To-morrow.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why not to-day? Time is every thing here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Remember, monsieur, that we have purchases to make&mdash;we visit the
capital but rarely.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Quite true; I was forgetting the solitude of your retreat. Such charms
might make any lapse of memory excusable.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, monsieur! I should be, indeed, touched by this flattery, if I could
but see the face of him who uttered it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pardon me, fair Countess, if I do not respond to even the least of your
wishes; we shall both appear in our true colours one of these days.
Meanwhile, remember our proverb that says, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not the cowl makes the
monk.&rsquo; When you shall hear this again, it will be in your château of
Vaugirarde, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is that the <i>consigne</i>, then?&rdquo; said she, laughing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that is the <i>consigne</i>,&mdash;don&rsquo;t forget it;&rdquo; and, with a
graceful salutation, the Maréchal withdrew to perfect his further
arrangements.
</p>
<p>
There was a listener to this scene, that none of its actors ever guessed
at&mdash;the poor actor, who, having lost his way among forests of
pasteboard and palaces of painted canvass, at last found himself at the
back of a pavilion, from which the speakers were not more than two paces
distant. Scarcely had the Maréchal departed, than he followed his steps,
and made all haste to an obscure <i>auberge</i> outside the barriers,
where a companion, poor and friendless as himself, awaited him. There is
no need to trace what ensued at this meeting. The farce-writer might,
indeed, make it effective enough, ending as it does in the resolve, that
since an engagement was denied them at Paris, they&rsquo;d try their fortune at
Fontainebleau, by personating the two strangers, who were to arrive by a
hazard at the Château de Vaugirarde.
</p>
<p>
The whole plot is now seen. They set out, and in due time arrive at the
château. Their wardrobe and appearance generally are the very reverse of
what the fair Countess expected, but as their stage experiences supply a
certain resemblance to rank and distinction&mdash;at least to her notions
of such&mdash;she never doubts that they are the promised visitors, and is
convinced by the significant declaration, that if their wayworn looks and
strange costume seem little indicative of their actual position, yet the
Countess should remember, &ldquo;It is not the cowl makes the monk.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The constraint with which each assumes a new character forms the second
era of the piece. The lover, far from suspecting the real pretensions he
should strive to personate&mdash;the Countess, as much puzzled by the
secrecy of her guest&rsquo;s conduct, and by guesses as to his actual rank and
fortune. It is while these doubts are in full conflict, and when seated at
supper, that the King and Richelieu appear, announced as two travellers,
whose carriage being overturned and broken, are fain to crave the
hospitality of the château.
</p>
<p>
The discomfiture of Richelieu and the anger of the King at finding the
ground occupied, contrast well with the patronising graces of the mock
Countess and the insolent demeanour of the lover, who whispers in her ear
that the new arrivals are strolling players, and that he has seen them
repeatedly in the provinces. All Richelieu&rsquo;s endeavours to set matters
right, unobserved by the King, are abortive; while his Majesty is scarce
more fortunate in pressing his suit with the fair Countess, by whose grace
and beauty he is fascinated. In the very midst of the insolent <i>badinage</i>
of the real actors, an officer of the household arrives, with important
despatches. Their delivery brooks no delay, and he at once presents
himself, and, kneeling, hands them to the King. Shame, discomfiture,
terror, and dismay, seize on the intruding players. The King, however, is
merciful. After a smart reproof all is forgiven; his Majesty sagely
observing, that although &ldquo;the Cowl may not make the Monk,&rdquo; the Ermine has
no small share in forming the Monarch.

<h2>
CHAPTER IX. <i>Florence</i>
</h2>
<p>
What did Shelley, what does any one, mean by their raptures about
Florence? Never, surely, was the epithet of <i>La Bella</i> more
misapplied. I can well understand the enthusiasm with which men call Genoa
<i>Il Superbo</i>. Its mountain background, its deep blue sea, its groves
of orange and acacia, the prickly aloe growing wild upon the very shore in
all the luxuriance of tropical vegetation, indicative of an almost
wasteful extravagance of production; while its amphitheatre of palaces,
proudly rising in terraced rows, are gorgeous remembrances of the haughty
Republic. But Florence! dark, dirty, and discordant! Palaces, gaol-like
and gloomy, stand in streets where wretchedness and misery seem to have
chosen their dwelling-place&mdash;the types of feudal tyranny side by side
with modern destitution. The boasted Arno, too, a shrunk-up, trickling
stream, not wide enough to be a river, not clear enough to be a rivulet,
winds along between hills hot and sun-scorched, where the brown foliage
has no touch of freshness, but stands parched and shrivelled by the hot
glare of eternal noon. The white-walled villas glisten in the dazzling
heat, not tempered by the slightest shade, but reflecting back the
scorching glow from rocks cracked and fissured by the sun!
</p>
<p>
How disappointing is all this! and how wearisome is the endeavour, from
the scattered objects here and there, to make any approach to that
Florence one has imagined to himself! To me the abstraction is impossible.
I carry about with me, even into the galleries, before the triumphs of
Raf-faelle and the wonders of Michael Angelo, the sad discordant scenes
through which I have passed. The jarred senses are rendered incapable of
properly appreciating and feeling those influences that should diffuse
their effect upon the mind; and even the sight of the &ldquo;Guardia Civica,&rdquo;
 strutting in solemn mockery beneath the archways where the proud Medici
have trod, are contrasts to suggest rather a sense of sarcasm than of
pleasure.
</p>
<p>
Here and there you do come upon some grand and imposing pile of building,
the very stones of which seem laid by giant hands; but even these have the
fortress character, the air of strongholds, rather than of princely
dwellings, as at Genoa. You see at once how much more defence and safety
were the guiding principles, than elegance of design and beauty of
proportion. No vestibule, peopled with its marble groups, opens here to
the passer-by a glimpse of a noble stair rising in spacious amplitude
between walls of marble. No gate of gilded fretwork shews the terraced
garden, with the plashing fountains, and the orange-trees bending with
their fruit.
</p>
<p>
Like all continental cities where the English congregate, the inhabitants
have a mongrel look, grafting English notions of dress and equipage upon
their own, and, like most imitators, only successful in following the
worst models. The Cascini, too, exhibits a very motley assemblage of gaudy
liveries and, dusky carriages, riding-grooms dressed like footmen, their
masters no bad resemblance to the &ldquo;Jeunes Premiers&rdquo; of a vaudeville. The
men are very inferior in appearance to the Milanese; they are neither as
well-built nor well-grown, and rarely have any pretensions to a
fashionable exterior. The women are mostly ill-dressed, and, in no
instance that I have seen, even well-looking. They have the wearied look,
without the seductive languor, of the South; they are pale, but not fair;
and their gestures are neither plastic nor graceful. In fact, in all that
I have seen here, I am sadly disappointed-all, save the Raffaelle&rsquo;s! they
are above my conception of them.
</p>
<p>
How much of this lies in myself I dare not stop to inquire; a large share,
perhaps, but assuredly not all. This climate should be avoided by those of
weak chest. Symptoms of further &ldquo;breaking-up&rdquo; crowd upon me each day; and
this burning sun and piercing wind make a sad conflict in the debilitated
frame. But where to go, where to seek out a quiet spot to linger a few
days and die! Rome is in all the agonies of its mock liberty&mdash;Naples
in open revolt: here, where I am, all rule and government have ceased to
exist; the mob have every thing at their mercy: that they have not abused
their power, is more owing to their ignorance than their honour. When the
Irish rebels carried the town of Ross by storm, they broke into the
grocers&rsquo; shops to eat sugar! The Florentines having bullied the Duke, are
only busied about the new uniforms of their Civic Guard!
</p>
<p>
Hitherto the reforms have gone no further than in organising this same
National Guard, and in thrashing the police authorities wherever found.
Now, bad as this police was, it was still the only protection to the
public peace. It exists no longer; and Tuscany has made her first step in
liberty &ldquo;<i>en Américaine</i>&rdquo; by adopting &ldquo;Lynch Law.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I was about to note down a singular instance of this indignant justice of
the people, when the arrival of a letter, in a hand unknown to me,
suddenly-routed all my intentions. If I am able to record the circumstance
here, calmly and without emotion, it is neither from that philosophy the
world teaches, nor from any higher motive&mdash;it is merely on the same
principle that one would bear with tolerable equanimity the break-down of
a carriage when within a few miles of the journey&rsquo;s end! The fact, then,
is simply this, that I, Horace Templeton, whose draughts a few days back
might have gone far into the &ldquo;tens of thousands,&rdquo; without fear of
&ldquo;dishonour,&rdquo; am now ruined! When we read this solemn word in the
newspapers, we at once look back to the rank and station of him whose ruin
is predicated. A Duke is &ldquo;ruined&rdquo; when he must sell three packs of hounds,
three studs of horses, four of his five or six mansions, part with his
yacht at Cowes, and his racers at Newmarket, and retire to the Continent
with a beggarly pittance of some fifteen thousand per annum. A Merchant is
ruined when, by the sudden convulsions of mercantile affairs, he is
removed from the unlimited command of millions to pass his days, at
Leamington or Cheltenham, on his wife&rsquo;s jointure of two thousand a-year.
</p>
<p>
His clerk is ruined when he drops his pocket-book on his way from the
Bank, and loses six hundred pounds belonging to the firm. His is more real
ruin, for it implies stoppages, suspicion&mdash;mayhap loss of place, and
its consequences.
</p>
<p>
But I have lost every thing! Hamerton and Scott, my bankers, have failed;
their liabilities, as the phrase is&mdash;meaning thereby what they are
liable to be asked for, but cannot satisfy&mdash;are enormous. My only
landed property is small, and so heavily mortgaged as to be worth nothing.
I had only waited for the term of an agreement to redeem the mortgage, and
clear off all encumbrances; but the &ldquo;crash&rdquo; has anticipated me, and I am
now a beggar!
</p>
<p>
Yes, there is the letter, in all cold and chilling civility, curtly
stating that &ldquo;the unprecedented succession of calamities, by which public
credit has been affected, have left the firm no other alternative but that
of a short suspension of payment! Sincerely trusting, however, that they
will be enabled&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and so forth. These announcements have but
one burden&mdash;the creditors are to be mulcted, while the debtor
continues to hope!
</p>
<p>
And now for my own share in the misfortune. Is it the momentary access of
excitement, or is it some passing rally in my constitution? but I
certainly feel better, and in higher spirits, than I have done for many a
day. It is long since I indulged in my old habit of castle-building; and
yet now, at every instant, some new notion strikes me, and I fancy some
new field for active labour and exertion. To the present Ministers I am
slightly known&mdash;sufficiently to ask for employment, if not in my
former career, in some other. Should this fail, I have yet powerful
friends to ask for me. Not that I like either of these plans&mdash;this
playing &ldquo;<i>antichambre</i>&rdquo; is a sore penance at my time of life. Had I
health and strength, I&rsquo;d emigrate. I really do wonder why men of a certain
rank, younger sons especially, do not throw their fortunes into the
colonies. Apart from the sense of enterprise, there is an immense gain, in
the fact that individual exertion, be it of head or hand, can exercise,
free from the trammels of conventional prejudices, which so rule and
restrain us at home. If we merely venture to use the pruning-knife in our
gardens here, there, we may lay the axe to the root of the oak; and yet,
in this commonwealth of labour, the gentleman, if his claim to the title
be really well founded, is as certain of maintaining a position of
superiority as though he had remained in his own country. The Vernons, the
Greys, and the Courtenays, have never ceased to hold a peculiar place
among their fellow-citizens of the United States; and so is it observable
in our colonies, even where mere wealth was found in the opposite scale.
</p>
<p>
But let me not longer dwell on these things, nor indulge in speculations
which lead to hope! Let me rather reflect on my present position, and
calculate calmly by what economy I may be able to linger on, and not
exhaust the means, till the lamp of life is ready to be quenched.
</p>
<p>
I am sure that most men of easy, careless temperament, could live as well
on one half of their actual incomes, having all that they require, and
never feeling any unusual privation; that the other half is invariably &ldquo;<i>mangé</i>&rdquo;
 by one&rsquo;s servants, by tradespeople, by cases of mock distress, by
importunity, and by indolence. I well know how I am blameable upon each of
these several counts. Now, for a note to my banker here, to ascertain what
sum he holds of mine; and then, like the shipwrecked sailor on his raft,
to see how long life may be sustained on half or quarter rations!
</p>
<p>
So, here is the banker&rsquo;s letter:&mdash;&ldquo;I have the honour to acknowledge,&rdquo;
 and so on. The question at issue is the sum&mdash;and here it stands:
Three hundred and forty-two pounds, twelve shillings, and fourpence. I
really thought I had double the amount; but here I find checks
innumerable. I have, no doubt, given to many, now far richer than I am. Be
it so. The next point is&mdash;How long can a man live on three hundred
and forty pounds? One man would say, Three weeks&mdash;another, as many
months&mdash;and another, as many years, perhaps. I am totally ignorant
what guidance to follow.
</p>
<p>
In this difficulty I shall send for Dr. Hennesy&mdash;he is the man in
repute here&mdash;and try, if it may be, to ascertain what length of
tether he ascribes to my case. Be it a day, a week, or a month, let me but
know it. And now to compose myself, and speak calmly on a theme where the
slightest appearance of excitement would create erroneous suspicions
against me. If H. be the man of sense I deem him, he will not misconstrue
my meaning, even should he guess it.
</p>
<p>
Gilbert reminds me of what I had quite forgotten&mdash;that yesterday I
signed an agreement for a villa here: I took it for six months, expecting
to live one! It struck me, when driving out on the Bologna road, both for
architecture and situation; I saw nothing equal to it&mdash;an old
summer-palace of the Medici, and afterwards inhabited by the Salviati,
whose name it bears.
</p>
<p>
A princely house in every way is this; but how unsuited to ruined
fortunes! I walked about the rooms, now stopping to examine a picture or a
carved oak cabinet; now to peep at the wild glens, which here are seen
dividing the hills in every direction; and felt how easy it would be to
linger on here, where objects of taste and high art blend their influence
with dreams of the long past. Now, I must address my mind to the different
question&mdash;How to be released from my contract?
</p>
<p>
H. has just been here. How difficult it was to force him into candour! A
doctor becomes, by the practice of his art, as much addicted to suspicion
as a police agent. Every question, every reply of the patient, must be a
&ldquo;symptom.&rdquo; This wearies and worries the nervous man, and renders him shy
and uncommunicative.
</p>
<p>
For myself, well opining how my sudden demand, &ldquo;How long can I live?&rdquo;
 might sound, if uttered with abrupt sincerity, I submitted patiently to
all the little gossip of the little world of this place,&mdash;its envy,
hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness&mdash;which certainly are prime
features in an English colony on the Continent&mdash;all, that I might at
last establish a character for soundness of mind and calmness of purpose,
ere I put my <i>quore</i>.
</p>
<p>
The favourable moment came at last, and I asked in full earnest, but with
a manner that shewed no sign of dread,&mdash;&ldquo;Tell me, <i>Dottore mio</i>,
how long may such a chest as mine endure? I mean, taking every possible
care, as I do; neither incurring any hazard nor neglect; and, in fact,
fighting the battle bravely to the last?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He tried at first, by a smile and a jocular manner, to evade the question;
but seeing my determination fixed, he looked grave, felt my pulse,
percussed my chest, and was silent.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, after a very long pause, &ldquo;I await my sentence, but in no
mood of hope or fear. Is it a month?&mdash;a week?&mdash;a day?&mdash;nay,
surely it can hardly be so near as that? Still silent! Come, this is
scarcely fair; I ask simply&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That which is perfectly impossible to answer, did I concede that I ought
to reply, as categorically as you ask.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Were I to tell my reasons, doctor, you might judge more harshly of my
intelligence than I should like; besides, you would certainly misinterpret
my meaning. Tell me, therefore, in the common course of such changes as my
disease involves, can I live a year? You shake your head! Be it so. Six
months?&mdash;Three, then?&mdash;Have I three? The winter, you say, is to
be feared. I know it. Well, then, shall I own that my convictions
anticipate you at each negative? I feel I have not a month&mdash;nay, not
half of one&mdash;a week will do it, doctor; and now excuse scant
ceremony, and leave me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Alone&mdash;friendless&mdash;homeless&mdash;ruined, and dying! Sad words
to write, each of them; sadder when thus brought in brotherhood together.
The world and its pageants are passing fast by me, like the eddies of that
stream which flows beneath my window. I catch but one glimpse and they are
gone, beneath the dark bridge of Death, to mingle in the vast ocean of
Eternity.
</p>
<p>
How strange to see the whole business of the world going on, the moving
multitude, the tumult of active minds and bodies,&mdash;at the very moment
when the creeping chill of ebbing life tells of days and hours numbered!
</p>
<p>
I am alone&mdash;not one to sit by me to combat thoughts that with the
faintest help I could resist, but which unaided are too strong for me. In
this window-seat where now I rest, who shall sit this day week? The youth,
perhaps, in gushing pride of heart and buoyancy, now entering upon life,
ardent and high-souled&mdash;or the young bride, gazing on that same river
that now I watch, and reading in its circles wreathed smiles of happy
promise. Oh, may no memories of him, whose tears fall fast now, haunt the
spot and throw their gloom on others!
</p>
<p>
I am friendless&mdash;and yet, which of those I still call friends would I
now wish beside me. To drink of the cup of consolation? I must first offer
my own of misery&mdash;nay, it is better to endure alone!
</p>
<p>
Homeless am I, too&mdash;and this, indeed, I feel bitterly. Old familiar
objects, associated with ties of affection, bound up with memories of
friends, are meet companions for the twilight hours of life. I long to be
back in my own chosen room&mdash;the little library, looking out on the
avenue of old beeches leading to the lake, and the village spire rising
amid the dark yew-trees. There was a spot there, too, I had often fancied&mdash;when
I close my eyes I think I see it still&mdash;a little declivity of the
ground beneath a large old elm, where a single tomb stood surrounded by an
iron railing; one side was in decay, and through which I often passed to
read the simple inscription&mdash;&ldquo;Courtenay Temple-ton, Armiger, aetatis
22.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This was not the family burying-place&mdash;why he was laid there was a
family mystery. His death was attributed to suicide, nor was his memory
ever totally cleared of the guilt. The event was briefly this:&mdash;On
the eve of the great battle of Fontenoy he received an insult from an
officer of a Scotch regiment, which ended in a duel. The Scotchman fell
dead at the first fire. Templeton was immediately arrested; and instead of
leading an attack, as he had been appointed to do, spent the hours of the
battle in a prison. The next morning he was discovered dead; a great
quantity of blood had flowed from his mouth and nose, which, although no
external wound was found, suggested an idea of self-destruction. None
suspected, what I have often heard since from medical men, that a rupture
of the aorta from excessive emotion&mdash;a broken heart, in fact&mdash;had
killed him: a death more frequently occurring than is usually believed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ruined and dying&rdquo; are the last words in my record; and yet neither
desirous of fortune nor life! At least, so faint is my hope that I should
use either with higher purpose than I have done, that all wish is
extinguished.
</p>
<p>
Seriously I believe, that love of life is less general than the habit of
projecting schemes for the future&mdash;a vague system of castle-building,
which even the least speculative practises; and that death is thus
accounted the great evil, as suddenly interrupting a chain of events whose
series is still imperfect. The very humblest peasant that rises to daily
toil has his gaze fixed on some future, some period of rest or repose,
some hour of freedom from his lifelong struggle. Now, I have exhausted
this source; the well, that once bubbled with eddying fancies of days to
come, is dry. High spirits, health, and the buoyancy that result from
both, when joined to a disposition keenly alive to enjoyment, and yet
neither cloyed by excess nor depraved by corrupt tastes, will always go
far to simulate a degree of ability. The very freedom a mind thus
constituted enjoys is a species of power; and its liberty exaggerates its
range, just as the untrammelled paces of the young colt seem infinitely
more graceful and noble than the matured regularity of the trained and
bitted steed.
</p>
<p>
It was thus that I set out in life&mdash;ardent, hopeful, and
enthusiastic: if my mental resources were small, they were always ready at
hand, like, a banker with a weak capital, but who could pay every trifling
demand on the spot, I lived upon credit; and upon that credit I grew rich.
Had I gone on freely as I began, I might still enjoy the fame of wealth
and solvency, but with the reputation of affluence came the wish to be
rich. I contracted my issues, I husbanded my resources, and from that hour
I became suspected. To avoid a &ldquo;run&rdquo; for gold, I ceased to trade and
retired. This, in a few words, is the whole history of my life.
</p>
<p>
Gilbert comes to say that the carriage is waiting to convey me to the
villa&mdash;our luggage is already there. Be it so: still I must own to
myself, that going to occupy a palace for the last few hours of life and
fortune is very much like good Christopher Sly&rsquo;s dream of Lordliness.

<h2>
CHAPTER X. SOME REVERIES ABOUT PLACES.
</h2>
<p>
What would the old school of Diplomatists have said if they saw their
secret wiles and machinations exposed to publicity, as is now the fashion?
When any &ldquo;honourable and learned gentleman&rdquo; can call for &ldquo;copies of the
correspondence between our Minister at the Court of&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
and the noble Secretary for the Foreign Department;&rdquo; and when the &ldquo;Times&rdquo;
 can, in a leader, rip up all the flaws of a treaty, or expose all the dark
intentions of some special compact? The Diplomatic &ldquo;Holy of Holies&rdquo; is now
open to the vulgar gaze, and all the mysteries of the craft as commonplace
as the transactions of a Poor-law Union.
</p>
<p>
Much of the &ldquo;prestige&rdquo; of this secrecy died out on the establishment of
railroads. The Courier who travelled formerly with breathless haste from
Moscow to London, or from the remotest cities of the far East, to our
little Isle of the West, was sure to bring intelligence several days
earlier than it could reach by any other channel. The gold greyhound,
embroidered on his arm, was no exaggerated emblem of his speed; but now,
his prerogative over, he journeys in &ldquo;a first-class carriage&rdquo; with some
fifty others, who arrive along with him. Old age and infancy, sickness and
debility, are no disqualifications&mdash;the race is open to all&mdash;and
the tidings brought by &ldquo;our messenger&rdquo; are not a particle later, and
rarely so full, as those given forth in the columns of a leading journal.
</p>
<p>
How impossible to affect any mysterious silence before the &ldquo;House!&rdquo;&mdash;how
vain to attempt any knowledge from exclusive sources! &ldquo;The ordinary
channels of information,&rdquo; to use Sir Robert&rsquo;s periphrasis, are the
extraordinary ones too; and not only do they contain whatever Ministers
know, but very often &ldquo;something more.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Time was when the Minister, or even the Secretary at a Foreign Court,
appeared in society as a kind of casquet of state secrets,&mdash;when his
mysterious whispers, his very gestures, were things to speculate on, and a
grave motion of his eyebrows could make &ldquo;Consols&rdquo; tremble, and throw the
&ldquo;Threes&rdquo; into a panic. Now the question is, Have you seen the City article
in the &ldquo;Times?&rdquo; What does the &ldquo;Chronicle&rdquo; say? No doubt this is a
tremendous power, and very possibly the enjoyment of it, such as we have
it in England, is the highest element of a pure democracy. Political
information of a very high order establishes a species of education, which
is the safest check upon the dangers of private judgment, and hence it is
fair to hope that we possess a sounder and more healthy public opinion in
England than in any of the states of the Continent. At least it would not
be too much to infer, that we would be less accessible to those sudden
convulsions, those violent &ldquo;<i>coups de main</i>&rdquo; by which Governments are
overturned abroad; and that the general diffusion of new notions on
political subjects, and the daily reference to such able expositors as our
newspaper press contains, are strong safeguards against the seductive
promises of mob-leaders and liberty-mongers.
</p>
<p>
In France, a Government is always at the mercy of any one bold enough to
lead the assault. The attempt may seem often a &ldquo;forlorn hope&rdquo;&mdash;it
rarely is so in reality. The love of vagrancy is not so inherent in the
Yankee as is the destructive passion in the Frenchman&rsquo;s heart; but it is
there, less from any pleasure in demolition than in the opportunity thus.
offered for reconstruction. Mirabeau, Rousseau, Fournier, La Mennais, are
the social architects of French predilection, and many a clearance has
been made to begin the edifice, and many have perished in laying the
foundations, which never rose above the earth, but which ere long we may
again witness undertaken with new and bolder hands than ever.
</p>
<p>
Events that once took centuries for their accomplishment, are now the work
of days or weeks. Steam seems to have communicated its impetuosity to mind
as well as matter, and ere many years pass over how few of the traces of
Old Europe will remain, as our fathers knew them?
</p>
<p>
I have scarcely entered a foreign city, for the last few years, without
detecting the rapid working of those changes. Old families sinking into
decay and neglect&mdash;time-honoured titles regarded as things that &ldquo;once
were.&rdquo; Their very homes, the palaces, associated with incidents of deep
historic interests, converted into hôtels or &ldquo;<i>Pensionnats</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The very last time I strolled through Paris, I loitered to the &ldquo;<i>Quartier</i>&rdquo;
 which, in my young ambition, I regarded with all the reverence the pilgrim
yields to Mecca. I remembered the first &ldquo;<i>soirée</i>&rdquo; in which I was
presented, having dined at the Embassy, and being taken in the evening, by
the Ambassador, that I might be introduced to the Machiavel of his craft,
Prince Talleyrand. Even yet I feel the hot blush which mantled in my cheek
as I was passing, with very scant ceremony, the round-shouldered little
old man who stood in the very doorway, his wide black coat, far too large
for his figure, and his white hair, trimly brushed back from his massive
temples.
</p>
<p>
It did not need the warning voice of my introducer, hastily calling my
name, to make my sense of shame a perfect agony. &ldquo;Monsieur Templeton,
Monsieur le Prince,&rdquo; said the Ambassador; &ldquo;the young gentleman of whom I
spoke;&rdquo; and he added, in a tone inaudible to me, something about my career
and some mention of my relatives.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; said the Prince, smiling graciously, &ldquo;I am aware how
‘connexion,&rsquo; as you call it, operates in England; but permit me,
Monsieur,&rdquo; said he, turning towards me, &ldquo;to give one small piece of
advice. It is this: &lsquo;If you can win by cards never score the honours.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 The precept had little influence on himself, however. No man ever paid
greater deference to the distinctions of rank, or conceded more to the
prestige of an ancient name. Neither a general, an orator, nor an author&mdash;not
even the leader of a faction&mdash;this astonishing man stood alone, in
the resources of his fertile intellect, directing events, which he
appeared to follow, and availing himself of resources which he had stored
up for emergency; but so artfully, that they seemed to arise out of the
natural current of events. Never disconcerted or abashed&mdash;not once
thrown off his balance&mdash;not more calmly dignified when he stood
beside Napoleon at Erfurth, then master of Europe itself, than he was at
the Congress of Vienna, when the defeat of France had placed her at the
mercy of her enemies.
</p>
<p>
It was in this same house, in the Rue Saint Florentin, that the Emperor
Alexander lived when the Allies entered Paris, on the last day of March,
1814. His Majesty occupied the first floor; M. de Talleyrand, the <i>rez
de chaussée</i>. He was then no more than ex-Minister for Foreign Affairs;
neither empowered by the Bourbons to treat for the Restoration, nor by the
nation for the conditions of a government&mdash;he was merely &ldquo;one among
the conquered;&rdquo; and yet to this man all eyes were turned instinctively, as
to one who possessed the secret of the future. That <i>rez de chaussée</i>
was besieged with visitors from morning till night; and even when,
according to the custom of the French, he made his lengthened toilette,
his dressing-room was filled by all the foreign ministers of the
conquering monarchs, and Nesselrode and Metternich waited at these daily
levées. In all these discussions M. de Talleyrand took the lead, with the
same ease and the same &ldquo;<i>àplomb</i>&rdquo; discussing kings to make and
kingdoms to dismember, as though the clank of the muskets, which now and
then interrupted their colloquy, came from the Imperial Guard of Napoleon,
and not the Cossacks of the Don and the Uhlans of the Danube, who crowded
the stairs and the avenues, and bivouacked in the court.
</p>
<p>
Here the Restoration was decided upon, and Talleyrand himself it was who
decided it. The Emperor Alexander opposed it strongly at first, alleging
that the old spirit and the old antipathies would all return with the
elder Bourbons, and suggesting the Duc d&rsquo;Orléans as king. Talleyrand,
however, overruled the objection, asserting that no new agent must be had
recourse to for governing at such a juncture, and that one usurpation
could not be succeeded by another. It is said that when the news reached
Vienna, in 1815, that Napoleon had landed from Elba, the Emperor Alexander
came hurriedly over to where Talleyrand was sitting, and informing him
what had occurred, said, &ldquo;I told you before your plan would be a failure!&rdquo;
 &ldquo;<i>Mais que faire?</i>&rdquo; coolly retorted the calm <i>diplomate</i>; &ldquo;of
two evil courses it was the better&mdash;I never said more of it. Had you
proclaimed the King of Rome, you had been merely maintaining the power of
Napoleon under another name. You cannot establish the government of a
great nation upon a half-measure. Besides that, Legitimacy, whatever its
faults, was the only Principle that could prove to Europe at large that
France and Napoleon were parted for ever; and, after so many barterings of
crowns and trucklings of kingdoms, it was a fine opportunity of shewing
that there was still something&mdash;whether it be or be not by right
divine&mdash;which was superior to sabres and muskets, generals and
armies.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It was the sanctity of right&mdash;whether of kings, people, or
individuals&mdash;which embodied Talleyrand&rsquo;s conception of the
Restoration; and this it was which he so admirably expressed when arriving
at the Congress of Vienna, the ambassador of a nation without wealth or
army. &ldquo;<i>Je viens</i>&rdquo; said he to the assembled Kings and Ministers of
conquering Europe&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Je viens et je vous apporte plus que vous
n&rsquo;avez,&mdash;Je vous apporte l&rsquo;idée du droit!</i>&rdquo; This was happily
expressed; but no one more than he knew how to epigrammatise a whole
volume of thought. In private life, the charm of his manner was the most
perfect thing imaginable: his consciousness of rank and ancient family
divested him of all pretension whatever, and the idea of entering the
lists with any one never occurred to his mind. Willingly availing himself
of the talents of others, and their pens upon occasion, he never felt any
embittering jealousy. Approachable by all, his unaffected demeanour was as
likely to strike the passing observer as the rich stores of his intellect
would have excited the admiration of a more reflecting one. Such was he
who has passed away from amongst us&mdash;perhaps the very last name of
the eventful era he lived in which shall claim a great place in history!
</p>
<p>
A singular picture of human vicissitude is presented to us in the aspect
of those places, but more particularly of those houses wherein great
events have once occurred, but where times&rsquo; change have brought new and
very different associations. A very few years, in this eventful century we
live in, will do this. The wonderful drama of the Empire sufficed to
impress upon every city of Europe some great and imposing reminiscence. A
small, unpretending little house, beside the ducal park at Weimar, was
Napoleon&rsquo;s resting-place for three days, when the whole world was at his
feet! The little salon where his receptions were held at evening&mdash;and
what receptions were they! the greatest Ministers and the most
distinguished Generals of Europe!&mdash;scarcely more than an ordinary
dressing-room in size, remains to this hour as he left it. One arm-chair,
a little larger than the others, stands at the window, which always lay
open. A table was placed upon the grass-plot outside, where several maps
were laid. The salon itself was too small to admit it, and here from time
to time the Emperor repaired, while with eagle glance and abrupt gesture
he marked out the future limits of the continental kingdoms, creating and
erasing monarchies, fashioning nations and people, in all the proud
wilfulness of Omnipotence! And now, while thinking of the Emperor, let me
bring to mind another local association.
</p>
<p>
In the handsomest part of the Chaussée d&rsquo;Antin, surrounded on every side
by the splendid palaces and gorgeous mansions of the wealthiest
inhabitants of Paris, stands a small, isolated, modest edifice, more like
a Roman villa than the house of some northern capital, in the midst of a
park; one of those pleasure-grounds which the French&mdash;Heaven knows
why&mdash;designate as &ldquo;Jardin Anglais.&rdquo; The outer gate opens on the Rue
Chantereine, and here to this hour you may trace, among the time-worn and
dilapidated ornaments, some remnants of the strange figures which once
decorated the pediment: weapons of various ages and countries, grouped
together with sphinxes and Egyptian emblems; the faint outlines of
pyramids, the peaceful-looking ibis, are there, among the helmets and
cuirasses, the massive swords and the death-dealing arms of our modern
warfare. In the midst of all, the number 52 stands encircled with a little
garland of leaves; but even they are scarce distinguishable now, and the
number itself requires the aid of faith to detect it.
</p>
<p>
Within, the place speaks of neglect and decay; the shrubs are broken and
uncared-for; the parterres are weed-grown; a few marble pedestals rise
amid the rank grass, to mark where statues once stood, but no other trace
of them remains: the very fountain itself is fissured and broken, and the
water has worn its channel along the herbage, and ripples on its wayward
course unrestrained. The villa is almost a ruin, the sashes have fallen in
in many places; the roof, too, has given way, and fragments of the mirrors
which once decorated the walls lie strewn upon the floor with pieces of
rare marble. Wherever the eye turns, some emblem of the taste of its
former occupant meets you. Some fresco, Stained with damp, and green with
mildew; some rustic bench, beneath a spreading tree, where the view opens
more boldly; but all are decayed. The inlaid floors are rotting; the
stuccoed ceilings, the richly-carved architraves, fall in fragments as
your footsteps move; and the doomed walls themselves seem scarce able to
resist the rude blast whose wailing cadence steals along them.
</p>
<p>
Oh, how tenfold more powerfully are the memories of the dead preserved by
the scenes they habited while in life, than by the tombs and epitaphs that
cover their ashes! How do the lessons of one speak home to the heart,
calling up again, before the mind&rsquo;s eye, the very images themselves! not
investing them with attributes our reason coldly rejects.
</p>
<p>
I know not the reason that this villa has been suffered thus to lapse into
utter ruin, in the richest quarter of so splendid a city. I believe some
long-contested litigation had its share in the causes. My present business
is rather with its past fortunes; and to them I will now return.
</p>
<p>
It was on a cold dark morning of November, in the year 1799, that the
street we have just mentioned, then called the Rue de la Victoire, became
crowded with equipages and horsemen; cavalcades of generals and their
staffs, in full uniform, arrived and were admitted within the massive
gateway, before which, now, groups of curious and inquiring gazers were
assembled, questioning and guessing as to the unusual spectacle. The
number of led horses that paraded the street, the long lines of carriages
on either side, nearly filled the way; still there reigned a strange,
unaccountable stillness, among the crowd, who, as if appalled by the very
mystery of the scene, repressed their ordinary tumult, and waited
anxiously to watch the result.
</p>
<p>
Among the most interested spectators were the inhabitants of the
neighbouring houses, who saw, for the first time in their lives, their
quiet quarter the scene of such excitement. Every window was filled with
faces, all turned towards that portal which so seldom was seen to open in
general; for they who dwelt there had been more remarkable for the
retirement and privacy of their habits than for aught else.
</p>
<p>
At each arrival the crowd separated to permit the equipage to approach the
gate; and then might be heard the low murmur&mdash;for it was no louder&mdash;of
&ldquo;Ha! that&rsquo;s Lasalle. See the mark of the sabre wound on his cheek!&rdquo; Or,
&ldquo;Here comes Angereau! You&rsquo;d never think that handsome fellow, with the
soft eye, could be such a tiger.&rdquo; &ldquo;Place there! place for Colonel Savary!&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Ah, dark Savary! we all know him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Stirring as was the scene without, it was far inferior to the excitement
that prevailed within the walls. There, every path and avenue that led to
the villa were thronged with military men, walking or standing together in
groups, conversing eagerly, and with anxious looks, but cautiously withal,
and as though half fearing to be overheard.
</p>
<p>
Through the windows of the villa might be seen servants passing and
repassing in haste, arranging the preparations for a magnificent <i>déjeûné</i>&mdash;for
on that morning the generals of division and the principal military men in
Paris were invited to breakfast with one of their most distinguished
companions&mdash;General Buonaparte.
</p>
<p>
Since his return from Egypt, Buonaparte had been living a life of apparent
privacy and estrangement from all public affairs. The circumstances under
which he had quitted the army under his command&mdash;the unauthorised
mode of his entry into France, without recall, without even permission&mdash;had
caused his friends considerable uneasiness on his behalf, and nothing
short of the unobtrusive and simple habits he maintained had probably
saved him from being called on to account for his conduct.
</p>
<p>
They, however, who themselves were pursuing the career of ambition, were
better satisfied to see him thus, than hazard any thing by so bold an
expedient. They believed that he was only great at the head of his
legions; and they felt a triumphant pleasure at the obscurity into which
the victor of Lodi and the Pyramids had fallen when measured with
themselves. They witnessed, then, with sincere satisfaction, the seeming
indolence of his present life. They watched him in those <i>soirées</i>
which Madame Buonaparte gave, enjoying his repose with such thorough
delight&mdash;those delightful evenings, the most brilliant for all that
wit, intellect, and beauty can bestow; which Talleyrand and Sieyes,
Fouché, Carnot, Lemercier, and a host of others frequented; and they
dreamed that his hour of ambition was over, and that he had fallen into
the inglorious indolence of the retired soldier.
</p>
<p>
While the greater number of the guests strolled listlessly through the
little park, a small group sat in the vestibule of the villa, whose looks
of impatience were ever turned towards the door from which their host was
expected to enter. One of those was a tall, slight man, with a high but
narrow forehead, dark eyes, deeply buried in his head, and overshadowed by
long, heavy lashes; his face was pale, and evinced evident signs of
uneasiness, as he listened, without ever speaking, to those about him.
This was General Moreau. He was dressed in the uniform of a General of the
day: the broad-skirted embroidered coat, the half-boot, the embroidered
tricolour scarf, and a chapeau with a deep feather trimming&mdash;a
simple, but a handsome costume, and which well became his well-formed
figure. Beside him sat a large, powerfully-built man, whose long black
hair, descending in loose curls on his neck and back, as well as the
jet-black brilliancy of his eye and deep olive complexion, bespoke a
native of the South. Though his dress was like Moreau&rsquo;s, there was a
careless jauntiness in his air, and a reckless &ldquo;<i>abandon</i>&rdquo; in his
manner, that gave the costume a character totally different. The very
negligence of his scarf-knot was a type of himself; and his
thickly-uttered French, interspersed here and there with Italian phrases,
shewed that Murat cared little to cull his words. At his left was a
hard-featured, stern-looking man, in the uniform of the Dragoons&mdash;this
was Andreossy; and opposite, and leaning on a sofa, was General Lannes. He
was pale and sickly; he had risen from a bed of illness to be present, and
lay with half-closed lids, neither noticing nor taking interest in what
went on about him.
</p>
<p>
At the window stood Marmont, conversing with a slight but handsome youth,
in the uniform of the Chasseurs. Eugène Beauharnois was then but
twenty-two, but even at that early age displayed the soldier-like ardour
which so eminently distinguished him in after-life.
</p>
<p>
At length the door of the salon opened, and Buonaparte, dressed in the
style of the period, appeared; his cheeks were sunk and thin; his hair,
long, flat, and silky, hung straight down at either side of his pale and
handsome face, in which now one faint tinge of colour marked either cheek.
He saluted the rest with a warm shake of the hand, and then stooping down,
said to Murat:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But Bernadotte&mdash;where is he?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yonder,&rdquo; said Murat, carelessly pointing to a group outside the terrace,
where a tall, fine-looking man, dressed in plain clothes, and without any
indication of the soldier in his costume, stood in the midst of a knot of
officers.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ha! General,&rdquo; said Napoleon, advancing towards him; &ldquo;you are not in
uniform. How comes this?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am not on service,&rdquo; was the cold reply.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, but you soon shall be,&rdquo; said Buonaparte, with an effort at cordiality
of manner.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I do not anticipate it,&rdquo; rejoined Bernadotte, with an expression at once
firm and menacing.
</p>
<p>
Buonaparte drew him to one side gently, and while he placed his arm within
his, spoke to him with eagerness and energy for several minutes; but a
cold shake of the head, without one word in reply, was all that he could
obtain.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Buonaparte, aloud, so that even the others heard him&mdash;&ldquo;what!
are you not convinced of it? Will not this Directory annihilate the
Revolution? have we a moment to lose? The Council of Ancients are met to
appoint me Commander-in-chief of the Army;&mdash;go, put on your uniform,
and join me at once.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I will not join a rebellion,&rdquo; was the insolent reply.
</p>
<p>
Buonaparte shrunk back and dropped his arm, then rallying in a moment,
added,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis well; you&rsquo;ll at least remain here until the decree of the Council is
issued.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Am I, then, a prisoner?&rdquo; said Bernadotte, with a loud voice.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no; there is no question of that kind: but pledge me your honour to
undertake nothing adverse to me in this affair.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;As a mere citizen, I will not do so,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;but if I am
ordered by a sufficient authority, I warn you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean, then, as a mere citizen!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That I will not go forth into the streets, to stir up the populace; nor
into the barracks, to harangue the soldiers.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Enough; I am satisfied. As for myself, I only desire to rescue the
Republic; that done, I shall retire to Malmaison, and live peaceably.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A smile of a doubtful, but sardonic character, passed over Bernadotte&rsquo;s
features as he heard these words, while he turned coldly away, and walked
towards the gate. &ldquo;What, Augureau! thou here?&rdquo; said he, as he passed
along, and with a contemptuous shrug he moved forward, and soon gained the
street. And truly, it seemed strange that he, the fiercest of the
Jacobins, the General who made his army assemble in clubs and knots to
deliberate during the campaign of Italy, that he should now lend himself
to uphold the power of Buonaparte!
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the salons were crowded in every part, party succeeding party
at the tables; where, amid the clattering of the breakfast and the
clinking of glasses, the conversation swelled into a loud and continued
din. Fouché, Berthier, and Talleyrand, were also to be seen,
distinguishable by their dress, among the military uniforms; and here now
might be heard the mingled doubts and fears, the hopes and dreads of each,
as to the coming events; and many watched the pale, care-worn face of
Bourienne, the secretary of Buonaparte, as if to read in his features the
chances of success; while the General himself went from room to room,
chatting confidentially with each in turn, recapitulating as he went the
phrase, &ldquo;The country is in danger!&rdquo; and exhorting all to be patient, and
wait calmly for the decision of the Council, which could not, now, be long
of coming.
</p>
<p>
As they were still at table, M. Carnet, the deputation of the Council,
entered, and delivered into Buonaparte&rsquo;s hands the sealed packet, from
which he announced to the assembly that the legislative bodies had been
removed to St. Cloud, to avoid the interruption of popular clamour, and
that he, General Buonaparte, was named Commander-in-chief of the Army, and
intrusted with the execution of the decree.
</p>
<p>
This first step had been effected by the skilful agency of Sieyes and
Roger Ducos, who spent the whole of the preceding night in issuing the
summonses for a meeting of the Council to such as they knew to be friendly
to the cause they advocated. All the others received theirs too late;
forty-two only were present at the meeting, and by that fragment of the
Council the decree was passed.
</p>
<p>
When Buonaparte had read the document to the end, he looked around him on
the fierce, determined faces, bronzed and seared in many a battle-field,
and said, &ldquo;My brothers in arms, will you stand by me here?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We will! we will!&rdquo; shouted they, with one roar of enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And thou, Lefebvre, did I hear thy voice there?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, General; to the death I&rsquo;m yours.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Buonaparte unbuckled the sabre he wore at his side, and placing it in
Lefebvre&rsquo;s hands, said, &ldquo;I wore this at the Pyramids; it is a fitting
present from one soldier to another. Now, then, to horse!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The splendid <i>cortège</i> moved along the grassy alleys to the gate,
outside which, now, three regiments of cavalry and three battalions of the
17th were drawn up. Never was a Sovereign, in all his pride of power,
surrounded with a more gorgeous staff. The conquerors of Italy, Germany,
and Egypt, the greatest warriors of Europe, were there grouped around him&mdash;whose
glorious star, even then, shone bright above him.
</p>
<p>
Scarcely had Buonaparte issued forth into the street than, raising his hat
above his head, he called aloud, &ldquo;<i>Vive la République!</i>&rdquo; The troops
caught up the cry, and the air rang with the wild cheers.
</p>
<p>
At the head of this force, surrounded by the Generals, he rode slowly
along towards the Tuileries, at the entrance to the gardens of which stood
Carnet, dressed in his robe of senator-in-waiting, to receive him. Four
Colonels, his aides-de-camp, marched in front of Buonaparte, as he entered
the Hall of the Ancients&mdash;his walk was slow and measured, and his air
studiously respectful.
</p>
<p>
The decree being read, General Buonaparte replied in a few broken phrases,
expressive of his sense of the confidence reposed in him: the words came
with difficulty, and he spoke like one abashed and confused. He was no
longer in front of his armed legions, whose war-worn looks inspired the
burning eloquence of the camp&mdash;those flashing images, those daring
flights, suited not the cold assembly, in whose presence he now stood&mdash;and
he was ill at ease and disconcerted. It was only, at length, when turning
to the Generals who pressed on after him, he addressed the following
words, that his confidence in himself came back, and that he felt himself
once more,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;This is the Republic we desire to have&mdash;and this we shall have; for
it is the wish of those who now stand around me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The cries of &ldquo;<i>Vive la République!</i>&rdquo; burst from the officers at once,
as they waved their <i>chapeaux</i> in the air, mingled with louder shouts
of &ldquo;<i>Vive le Général!</i>&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
If the great events of the day were now over with the Council, they had
only begun with Buonaparte.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Whither now, General?&rdquo; said Lefebvre, as he rode to his side.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To the guillotine, I suppose,&rdquo; said Andreossy, with a look of sarcasm.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We shall see that,&rdquo; was the cold answer of Buonaparte, while he gave the
word to push forward to the Luxembourg.
</p>
<p>
This was but the prologue, and now began the great drama, the greatest,
whether for its interest or its actors&mdash;that ever the world has been
called to witness.
</p>
<p>
We all know the sequel, if sequel that can be called which our own days
would imply is but the prologue of the piece!

CHAPTER XI. <i>Villa Scalviati, near Florence</i>
</h2>
<p>
I have had a night of ghostly dreams and horrors; the imagination of Monk
Lewis, or, worse, of Hoffman himself, never conceived any thing so
diabolical. H., who visited me last evening, by way of interesting me
related the incidents of a dreadful murder enacted in the very room I
slept in. There was a reality given to the narrative by the presence of
the scene itself&mdash;the ancient hangings still on the walls&mdash;the
antique chairs and cabinets standing, as they had done, when the deed of
blood took place; but, more than all, by the marble bust of the murderess
herself: for it was a woman, singularly beautiful, young, and of the
highest rank, who enacted it. The story is this:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
The Villa, which originally was in possession of the Medici family, and
subsequently of the Strozzi&rsquo;s, was afterwards purchased by Count Juliano,
one of the most distinguished of the Florentine nobility.
</p>
<p>
With every personal advantage&mdash;youth, high station, and immense
wealth, he was married to one his equal in every respect, and might thus
have seemed an exception to the lot of humanity, his life realising, as it
were, every possible element of happiness. Still he was not happy; amid
all the voluptuous enjoyments of a life passed in successive pleasures,
the clouded brow and drooping eye told that some secret sorrow preyed upon
him, and that his gay doublet in all its bravery covered a sad and
sorrowing heart. His depression was generally attributed to the fact that,
although now married three years, no child had been born to their union,
or any likelihood that he should leave an heir to his great name and
fortune. Not even to his nearest friends, however, did any confession
admit this cause of sorrow; nor to the Countess, when herself lamenting
over her childless lot, did he seem to shew any participation in the
grief.
</p>
<p>
The love of solitude, the desire to escape from all society, and pass
hours, almost days, alone in a tower, the only admittance to which was by
a stair from his own chamber, had now grown upon him to that extent, that
his absence was regarded as a common occurrence by the guests of the
castle, nor even excited a passing notice from any one. If others ceased
to speculate on the Count&rsquo;s sorrow, and the daily aversion he exhibited to
mixing with the world, the Countess grew more and more eager to discover
the source. All her blandishments to win his secret from him were,
however, in vain; vague answers, evasive replies, or direct refusals to be
interrogated, were all that she met with, and the subject was at length
abandoned,&mdash;at least by these means.
</p>
<p>
Accident, however, disclosed what all her artifice had failed in&mdash;the
key of the secret passage to the tower, and which the Count never
entrusted to any one, fell from his pocket one day, when riding from the
door; the Countess eagerly seized it, and guessing at once to what it
belonged, hastened to the Count&rsquo;s chamber.
</p>
<p>
The surmise was soon found to be correct; in a few moments she had entered
the winding stairs, passing up which, she reached a small octagon chamber
at the summit of the tower. Scarcely had her eager eyes been thrown around
the room, when they fell upon a little bed, almost concealed beneath a
heavy canopy of silk, gorgeously embroidered with the Count&rsquo;s armorial
bearings. Drawing rudely aside the hangings, she beheld the sleeping
figure of a little boy, who, even in his infantine features, recalled the
handsome traits of her husband&rsquo;s face. The child started and awoke with
the noise, and looking wildly up, cried out, &ldquo;Papa;&rdquo; and then suddenly
changing his utterance, said, &ldquo;Mamma.&rdquo; Almost immediately, however,
discovering his error, he searched with anxious eyes around the chamber
for those he was wont to see beside him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; said the Countess, in a voice that trembled with the most
terrible conflict of terror and jealousy, excited to the verge of madness.
&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Il Conte Juliano,&rdquo; said the child, haughtily; and shewing at the same
time a little medallion of gold embroidered on his coat, and displaying
the family arms of the Julianos.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come with me, then, and, see your father&rsquo;s castle,&rdquo; said the Countess;
and she lifted him from the bed, and led him down the steps of the steep
stairs into, her husband&rsquo;s chamber.
</p>
<p>
It was the custom of the period, that the lady, no matter how exalted her
rank, should with her own hands arrange the linen which composed her
husband&rsquo;s toilet, and this service was never permitted to be discharged by
any less exalted member of the household. When the Count returned, toward
night-fall, he hastened to his room&mdash;an invitation, or command, to
dine at the Court that day compelling him to dress with all speed. He
asked for the Countess as he passed up the stairs, but paid no attention
to the reply, for as he entered his chamber he found she had already
performed the accustomed office, and that the silver basket, with its
snow-white contents, lay ready to his hand. With eager haste he proceeded
to dress, and took up the embroidered shirt before him. When, horror of
horrors! there lay beneath it the head of his child, severed from the
body, still warm and bleeding&mdash;the dark eyes glaring as if with but
half-extinguished life, the lips parted as if yet breathing! One cry of
shrill and shrieking madness was heard through every vaulted chamber of
that vast castle; the echoes were still ringing with it as the maddened
father tore wildly from chamber to chamber in search of the murderess. She
had quitted the castle on horseback two hours before. Mounting his
swiftest horse he followed her from castle to castle; the dreadful chase
continued through the night and the next day; a few hours of terrible
slumber refreshed him again to pursue her; and thus he wandered over the
Apennines and the vast plain beyond them, days, weeks, months long, till
in a wild conflict of his baffled vengeance and insanity he died! She was
never heard of more!
</p>
<p>
Such is the horrid story of the chamber in which I sit; her bust, that of
a lovely and gentle girl, fast entering into womanhood, is now before me;
the forehead and the brows are singularly fine; the mouth alone reveals
any thing of the terrible nature within; the lips are firm and compressed&mdash;the
under one drawn slightly&mdash;very slightly&mdash;backward. The head
itself is low, and, for the comfort of phrenologists, sadly deficient in
&ldquo;veneration.&rdquo; The whole character of the face is, however, beautiful, and
of a classic order. It is horrible to connect the identity with a tale of
blood.
</p>
<p>
With this terrible tragedy still dwelling on my mind, and the features of
her who enacted it, I fell asleep. The room in which I lay had witnessed
the deed. The low portal in the corner, concealed behind the arras, led to
the stairs of the tower; the deep window in the massive wall looked out
upon the swelling landscape over which she fled, and he, in mad fury,
pursued her: these, were enough to seize and hold the mind, and, blending
the actual with the past, to make up a vision of palpable reality.
Oftentimes did I start from sleep. Now, it was the fancy of a foot upon
the tower stair; now, a child&rsquo;s fairy step upon the terrace overhead; now,
I heard, in imagination, the one, wild, fearful cry, uttered as if the
reeling senses could endure no more! At last I found it better to rise and
sit by the window, so overwrought and excited had my brain become. Day was
breaking, not in the cold grey of a northern dawn, but in a rich glow of
violet-coloured light, which, warmer on the mountain-tops, gradually
merged into a faint pinkish hue upon the lesser hills, and became still
fainter in the valleys and over the city itself. A light, gauzy mist,
tracked out in the air the course of the Arno; but so frail was this
curtain, that the sun&rsquo;s rays were already rending and scattering its
fragments, giving through the breaches bright peeps of villas, churches,
and villages on the mountain sides: the great dome, too, rose up in solemn
grandeur; and the tall tower of Santa Croce stood, sentinel like, over the
sleeping city. Already the low sounds of labour, awakening to its daily
call, were heard; the distant rumbling of the heavy waggon, the crashing
noise of branches, as the olive-trees beside the road brushed against the
lumbering teams; and, further off, the cheering voices of the boatmen,
whose fast barks were hurrying along the rapid Arno;&mdash;all pleasant
sounds, for they spoke of life and movement, of active minds and labouring
hands, the only bulwarks against the corroding thoughts that eat into the
sluggish soul of indolence.
</p>
<p>
For this fair scene&mdash;these fresh and balmy odours&mdash;this
brilliant blending of blue sky and rosy earth, I could unsay all that I
have said of Florence, and own, that it is beautiful! I could wish to sit
here many mornings to come, and enjoy this prospect as now I do. Vain
thought! as if I could follow my mind to the contemplation of the fair
scene, and so rove away in fancy to all that I have dreamed of, have loved
and cared for, have trusted and been deceived in!
</p>
<p>
I must be up and stirring&mdash;my time grows briefer. This hand, whose
blue veins stand out like knotted cordage, is fearfully attenuated;
another day or two, perhaps, the pen will be too much fatigue; and I have
still &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; to say to many&mdash;friends?&mdash;ay, the word will
serve as well as another. I have letters to write&mdash;some to read over
once again; some to burn without reading. This kind of occupation&mdash;this
&ldquo;setting one&rsquo;s house in order,&rdquo; for the last time&mdash;is like a rapid
survey taken of a whole life, a species of overture, in which fragments of
every air of the piece enter, the gay and cheerful succeeded by the sad
and plaintive, so fast as almost to blend the tones together; and is not
this mingled strain the very chord that sounds through human life?
</p>
<p>
Here, then, for my letter-box. What have we here?&mdash;a letter from the
Marquis of D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, when he believed himself high in
ministerial favour, and in a position to confer praise or censure:&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;<i>Carlton Club</i>.

&ldquo;Dear Tempy,

&ldquo;Your speech was admirable&mdash;first-rate; the quotation
from Horace, the neatest thing I ever heard; and
astonishing, because so palpably unpremeditated. Every one
I&rsquo;ve met is delighted, and all say that, with courage and
the resolve to succeed, the prize is your own. I go to
Ireland, they say, or Paris. The latter if I can; the
former if I must. In either case, will you promise to come
with me? The assurance of this would be a very great relief
to

&ldquo;Yours, truly,

&ldquo;D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
What have we pinned to the back of this? Oh, a few lines in pencil from
Sir C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, received, I see, the
same evening.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Dear T.,

&ldquo;Sir H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; is not pleased with your speech,
although he owns it was clever.   The levity he disliked,
because he will not give D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; any pretence for continuing
this system of personalities. The bit of Horace had been
better omitted; Canning used the same lines once before,
and the <i>réchauffée</i>&mdash;if it were such&mdash;was poor.   The
Marquis of D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; was twice at Downing Street, to say that
he had &lsquo;crammed&rsquo; you. This, of course, no one believes; but
he takes the merit of your speech to himself, and claims
high reward in consequence.   He asks for an Embassy!
This is what Lord L&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; calls &lsquo;too bad.&rsquo;   Come over to-
morrow before twelve o&rsquo;clock.

&ldquo;Believe me yours,

&ldquo;C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Go in and win, old boy! You&rsquo;ve made capital running, and
for the start too&mdash;distanced the knowing ones, and no
mistake! The odds are seven to four that you&rsquo;re in the

Tramp wins the Goodwood, and that you&rsquo;re in&mdash;double event.
So look out sharp, and don&rsquo;t baulk &ldquo;Yours ever,

&ldquo;Dear Friend,

&ldquo;We have just heard of your success.   Brilliant and
fascinating as it must be, do not forget those who long to
share your triumph.   Come over here at once.   We waited
supper till two; and now we are sitting here, watching
every carriage, and opening the window at every noise in the
street. Come then, and quickly.

<p>
And here is the last of the batch:&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;The D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; of B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; presents his compliments to Mr.
Templeton, and begs to inform him that his ancestor was not
the Marquis of T&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; who conducted the negotiations at
Malaga;&rsquo; neither were &lsquo;thirty thousand pounds voted by the
last Parliament to the family by way of secret service for
parliamentary support,&rsquo; but in compensation for two patent
offices abolished&mdash;Inspectorship of Gold Mines, and Ordnance
Comptrollership. And, lastly, that &lsquo;Infamous speech,&rsquo; so
pathetically alluded to, was made at a private theatrical
meeting at Lord Mudbury&rsquo;s in Kent, and not &lsquo;on the
hustings,&rsquo; as Mr. T. has asserted.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
So much for one event, and in itself a trivial one! Who shall say that any
act of his life is capable of exciting even an approach to unanimous
praise or censure? This speech, which on one side won me the adhesion of
some half-dozen clubs, the praise of a large body of the Upper House, the
softest words that the &ldquo;beauty of the season&rdquo; condescended to utter,
brought me, on the other, the coldness of the Minister, the chilling
civility of mock admiration, and lost me the friendship&mdash;in House of
Commons parlance&mdash;of the leading member of the Government!
</p>
<p>
And here is a strange, square-shaped epistle, signed in the corner,
&ldquo;Martin Haverstock.&rdquo; This rough-looking note was my first step in
Diplomacy! I was a very young <i>attaché</i> to the mission at Florence,
when, on returning to England through Milan, I was robbed of my trunk, and
with it of all the money I possessed for my journey. It was taken by a
process very well known in Italy, being cut off from the back of the
carriage, not improbably, with the concurrence of the driver. However that
might be, I arrived at the &ldquo;Angelo d&rsquo;Oro&rdquo; without a sou. Having ordered a
room, I sat down by myself, hungry and penniless, not having a single
acquaintance at Milan, nor the slightest idea how to act in the emergency.
My very passport was gone, so that I had actually nothing to authenticate
my position&mdash;not even my name.
</p>
<p>
I sent for the landlord, who, after a very cold interview, referred me to
the Consul; but the Consul had on that very morning left the city for
Verona, so that his aid was cut off. My last resource&mdash;my only one,
indeed&mdash;was to write to Florence for money, and wait for the answer.
This was a delay of seven, possibly of eight, days, but it was
unavoidable.
</p>
<p>
This done, I ordered supper&mdash;a very humble one too, and befitting the
condition of one who had not wherewithal to pay for it. I remember still
the sense of shame I felt as the waiter, on entering, looked around for my
luggage, and saw neither trunk nor carpet-bag&mdash;not even a hat-box. I
thought&mdash;nay, there could be no mistake about it, it was quite clear&mdash;he
laid the table with a certain air of careless and noisy indifference that
bespoke his contempt. The very bang of the door as he went out, was a
whole narrative of my purseless state.
</p>
<p>
I had been very hungry when I ordered the meal. I had not tasted food for
several hours, and yet now I could not eat a morsel; chagrin and shame had
routed all appetite, and I sat looking at the table, and almost wondering
why the dishes were there. I thought of all the kind friends far away, who
would have been so delighted to assist me; who, at that very hour perhaps,
were speaking of me affectionately; and yet I had not one near, even to
speak a word of counsel, or say one syllable of encouragement. It was not,
it may well be believed, the monied loss that afflicted me&mdash;the sum
was neither large, nor did I care for it. It was the utter desolation, and
the sense of dependence, that galled me&mdash;a feeling whose painful
tortures, even temporary as they were, I cannot, at this hour, eradicate
from my memory.
</p>
<p>
Had I been left enough to continue my journey in the very humblest way, on
foot even, it would have been happiness compared with what I felt. I arose
at last from the table, where the untasted food still stood, and strolled
out into the streets. I wandered about listlessly, not even feeling that
amusement the newly seen objects of a great city almost always confer, and
it was late when I turned back to the inn. As I entered, a man was
standing talking with the master of the house, who, in his broken English,
said, as I passed, &ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; I at once suspected that my sad
adventure had been the subject of conversation, and hurried up the stairs
to hide my shame. In my haste, however, I forgot my key at the porter&rsquo;s
lodge, and was obliged to go back to fetch it. On doing so, I met on the
stairs a large, coarse-looking man, with a florid face, and an air of
rough but of simple good-nature in his countenance. &ldquo;You are a countryman,
I believe?&rdquo; said he in English. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve just heard of what has
happened to you. The rascals tried the same trick with me at Modena; but I
had an iron chain around <i>my</i> trunk, and as they were baulked, and
while they were rattling at it, I got a shot at one of them with a pistol&mdash;not
to hurt the devil, for it was only duck-shot; not a bullet, you know.
Where&rsquo;s your room?&mdash;is this it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I hesitated to reply, strange enough; though he shewed that he was well
aware of all my loss. I felt ashamed to shew that I had no baggage, nor
any thing belonging to me. He seemed to guess what passed in my mind, and
said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bless your heart, sir, never mind me. I know the rogues have stripped you
of all you had; but I want to talk to you about it, and see what is best
to be done.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This gave me courage. I unlocked the door, and shewed him in.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I suspected how it was,&rdquo; said he, looking at the table, where the dishes
stood untouched; &ldquo;you could not eat by yourself, nor I either: so come
along with me, and we&rsquo;ll have a bit of supper together, and chat over your
business afterwards.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Perhaps I might have declined a more polished invitation; whether or not,
it was of no use to refuse him, for he would not accept an excuse; and
down we went to his chamber, and supped together. Unlike my slender meal,
his was excellent, and the wine first-rate. He made me tell him about the
loss of my trunk, twice over, I believe; and then he moralised a great
deal about the rascality of the Continent generally, and Italy in
particular, which, however, he remembered, could not be wondered at,
seeing that three-fourths of the population of every rank did nothing but
idle all day long. After that he inquired whether I had any pursuit
myself; and although pleased when I said Yes, his gratification became
sensibly diminished on learning the nature of the employment, &ldquo;I may be
wrong,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I have always taken it, that you diplomatic folk
were little better than spies in gold-laced coats&mdash;fellows that were
sent to pump sovereigns and bribe their ministers.&rdquo; I took a deal of
pains, &ldquo;for the honour of the line,&rdquo; to undeceive him; and, whether I
perfectly succeeded or not, I certainly secured his favour towards myself,
for, before we parted, it was all settled that I was to travel back with
him to England, he having a carriage and a strong purse, and that he was
to be my banker in all respects till I reached my friends.
</p>
<p>
As we journeyed along through France, where my knowledge of the language
and the people seemed to give the greatest pleasure to my companion, he
informed me that he was a farmer near Nottingham, and had come abroad to
try and secure an inheritance bequeathed to him by a brother, who for
several years had been partner in a great silk factory near Piacenza. In
this he had only partly succeeded, the Government having thrown all
possible obstructions in his way; still he was carrying back with him
nearly twenty thousand pounds&mdash;a snug thing, as he said, for his
little girl, for he was a widower with an only child. Of Amy he would talk
for hours&mdash;ay, days long! It was a theme of which he never wearied.
According to him, she was a paragon of beauty and accomplishments. She had
been for some time at a boarding-school at Brighton, and was the pride of
the establishment. &ldquo;Oh, if I could only shew her to you!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But
why couldn&rsquo;t I? what&rsquo;s to prevent it? When you get to England and see your
friends, what difficulty would there be in coming down to Hodley for a
week or two? If you like riding, the Duke himself at Retton Park has not
two better bred ones in his stable than I have!&rdquo; No need to multiply his
arguments and inducements: I agreed to go, not only to, but actually with
him&mdash;the frank good-nature of his character won on me at every
moment, and, long before we arrived at Calais, I had conceived for him the
strongest sentiments of affection.
</p>
<p>
From the moment he touched English ground his enthusiasm rose beyond all
bounds; delighted to be once back again in his own country, and travelling
the well-known road to his own home, he was elated like a schoolboy. It
was never an easy thing for me to resist the infectious influence of any
temperament near me, whether its mood was grave or gay, and I became as
excited and overjoyed as himself; and I suppose that two exiles, returning
from years of banishment, never gave themselves up to greater transports
than did we at every stage of our journey. I cannot think of this without
astonishment, for, in honest truth, I was all my life attached to the
Continent&mdash;from my earliest experience I had preferred the habits and
customs to our own, and yet, such was the easy and unyielding compliance
of my nature, that I actually fancied that my Anglo-mania was as great as
his own.
</p>
<p>
At last we reached Hodley, and drove up a fine, trimly-kept gravel avenue,
through several meadows, to a long comfortable-looking farmhouse, at the
door of which, in expectant delight, stood Amy herself. In the oft-renewed
embraces she gave her father I had time to remark her well, and could see
that she was a fine, blue-eyed, fair-haired, handsome girl&mdash;a very
flattering specimen of that good Saxon stock we are so justly proud of;
and if not all her father&rsquo;s partiality deemed as regarded ladylike air and
style, she was perfectly free from any thing like pretension or any
affectation whatever. This was my first impression: subsequent
acquaintance strengthened it. In fact, the Brighton boarding-school had
done no mischief to her; she had not learned a great deal by her two
years&rsquo; residence, but she had not brought back any toadying subserviency
to the more nobly born, any depreciating sense of her former companions,
or any contempt for the thatched farmhouse at Hodley and its honest owner.
</p>
<p>
If our daily life at the farm was very unvarying, it was exceedingly
pleasurable; we rose early, and I accompanied Martin into the fields with
the workmen, where we remained till breakfast. After which I usually
betook myself to a little brook, where there was excellent fishing, and
where, her household duties over, Amy joined me. We dined about two; and
in the afternoon we&mdash;that is, Amy and myself&mdash;rode out together;
and as we were admirably mounted, and she a capital horsewoman, usually
took a scamper &ldquo;cross country,&rdquo; whenever the fences were not too big and
the turf inviting. Home to tea, and a walk afterwards through the green
lanes and mossy paths of the neighbourhood, filled the day; and however
little exciting the catalogue of pursuits, when did I feel time pass so
swiftly? Let me be honest and avow, that the position I enjoyed had its
peculiar flattery. There was through all their friendship a kind of
deferential respect&mdash;a sense of looking up to me, which I was young
enough to be wonderfully taken by: and my experiences at Foreign Courts&mdash;which
Heaven knows were few and meagre enough&mdash;had elevated me in their
eyes into something like Lord Whitworth or Lord Castlereagh; and I really
believe, that all the pleasure my stories and descriptions afforded was
inferior to the delight they experienced in seeing the narrator, and
occasionally the actor, in the scenes described, their own guest at their
own table.
</p>
<p>
It was while revelling in the fullest enjoyment of this pleasant life that
I received a Foreign Office letter, in reply to an application I had made
for promotion, rejecting my request, and coolly commanding my immediate
return to Florence. These missives were not things to disobey, and it was
in no very joyful mood I broke the tidings to my host.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it worth?&rdquo; said Martin, abruptly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, in point of money,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the appointments are poor things. It is
only that there are some good prizes in the wheel, and, whether one is
lucky enough to gain them or not, even Hope is something. My salary is not
quite two hundred a-year!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Martin gave a long, low whistle, and said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, dang it! my poor brother George, that&rsquo;s gone, had six hundred when
he went out as inspector over that silk factory! Two hundred a-year!&rdquo;
 mused he; &ldquo;and what do you get at your next promotion?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That is not quite certain. I might be named <i>attaché</i> at Vienna,
which would, perhaps, give me one hundred more&mdash;or, if I had the good
fortune to win the Ministers favour, I might be made a Secretary at some
small legation and have five hundred&mdash;that is, however, a piece of
luck not to be thought of.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; sighed Martin; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no judge of these matters; but it
strikes me that&rsquo;s very poor pay, and that a man like myself, who has his
ten or twelve hundreds a-year&mdash;fifteen in good seasons&mdash;is
better off than the great folk dining with kings or emperors.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course you are,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;who doubts it? But we must all do something.
England is not a country where idleness is honourable.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why not turn farmer?&rdquo; said Martin, energetically; &ldquo;you&rsquo;d soon learn the
craft, I&rsquo;ve not met any one this many a-year picks up the knowledge about
it like yourself. You seem to like the life too.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If you mean such as I live now, I delight in it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you, my dear boy?&rdquo; cried he, grasping my hand, and squeezing it
between both his own. &ldquo;If so, then never leave us. You shall live with us&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
take that great piece of land there near the haugh&mdash;I&rsquo;ve had an eye
on it for years back; there&rsquo;s a sheep run there as fine as any in Europe.
I&rsquo;ll lay down the whole of those two fields into meadow, and keep the
green crops to the back altogether. Such partridge-shooting we will have
there yet. In winter, too, the Duke&rsquo;s hounds meet twice a-week. I&rsquo;ve got
such a strapping three-year-old&mdash;you haven&rsquo;t seen him, but he&rsquo;ll be a
clipper. Well, don&rsquo;t say nay. You&rsquo;ll stay and marry Amy. I&rsquo;ll give her
twenty thousand down, and leave you all I have afterwards.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This was poured forth in such a voluble strain, that an interruption was
impossible; and at last, when over, the speaker stood with tearful eyes,
gazing on me, as if on my reply his very existence was hanging.
</p>
<p>
Surprise and gratitude for the unbounded confidence he had shewn in me
were my first sensations, soon to be followed by a hundred other
conflicting and jarring ones. I should shame&mdash;even now, after years
have gone by&mdash;to own to some of these. Alas! our very natures are at
the mercy of the ordinances we ourselves have framed; and the savage red
man yields not more devotion to the idol he has carved, than do we to the
fashion we have made our Deity! I thought of the Lady Georginas and
Carolines of my acquaintance, and grew ashamed of Amy Haverstock! If I had
loved, this I am sure would not have been the case, but I cannot acquit
myself that principle and good feeling should not have been sufficient
without love! Whether from the length of time in which I remained without
answering, or that in my confusion he read something adverse to his
wishes, but Martin grew scarlet, and in a voice full of emotion said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There, Mr. Templeton, enough said. I see it will not do&mdash;there&rsquo;s no
need of explaining. I was a fool, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But will you not let me, at least, reflect?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, sir; not a second. If
my offer was not as frankly taken as made&mdash;ay, and on the instant too&mdash;I
am only the more ashamed for ever making it: but there&rsquo;s an end on&rsquo;t. If
you would be as good friends parting with me as we have been hitherto,
never speak of this again.&rdquo; And so saying, Martin turned on his heel and
walked hastily away. I followed him after a second, but he waved me back
with his hand, and I was forced to comply.
</p>
<p>
That day Amy and I dined alone together. Her father, she said, &ldquo;had got a
bad headache;&rdquo; and this she said with such evident candour, it was clear
she knew nothing of our interview. The dinner was to me, at least, a very
constrained affair; nor were my sensations rendered easier as she said&mdash;&ldquo;My
father tells me that you are obliged to leave us this evening, Mr.
Templeton. I&rsquo;m very sorry for it; but I hope we&rsquo;ll meet soon again.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
We did not meet soon again, or ever. I left the farm that night for
London. Martin came to the door from his bed to wish me good-by. He looked
very ill, and only spoke a few words. His shake-hands was, however,
hearty; and his &ldquo;God bless you,&rdquo; uttered with kind meaning.
</p>
<p>
I have never seen that neighbourhood since.
</p>
<p>
It was about two years after that I received a letter&mdash;the very one
now before me&mdash;superscribed Martin Haverstock. It was brief, and to
this effect. The Secretary for Foreign Affairs being a candidate for the
representation in Parliament of the county in which Martin held a large
stake, had, in acknowledgment of his friend Mr. Haverstock&rsquo;s exertions in
his support, been only too happy to consider the application made
respecting Mr. H.&lsquo;s young friend, who, by the next Gazette, would be
announced for promotion.
</p>
<p>
And thus I was made Secretary of Legation at Studtgart!
</p>
<p>
There was a postscript to Martin&rsquo;s letter, which filled me with strange
and varying emotions:&mdash;-&ldquo;Amy is sorry that her baby is a little girl;
she&rsquo;d like to have called it &lsquo;Horace.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This packet I need not open. The envelope is superscribed, &ldquo;Hints and Mems
for H.T. during his residence at the Court of M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;
 They were given in a series of letters from old Lord H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
who had long been a resident Minister there, and knew the people
thoroughly. I followed, very implicitly too, the counsels he gave, and was
said to have acquitted myself well, for I was &ldquo;<i>Chargé d&rsquo;Affaires</i>.&rdquo;
 But what absurdity it is to suppose that any exclusive information is ever
obtainable by a Minister, except when the Government itself is disposed to
afford it! I remember well, the spy we employed was also in the pay of the
French Embassy. He was a Sardinian, and had spent some years of his life
an Austrian prisoner in a fortress. We all believed, whatever the fellow&rsquo;s
sentiments on other subjects, that he was a profound hater of Austria.
Well, it turned out that he sold us all to Metternich.
</p>
<p>
Old Sir Robert W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; used to say to his <i>attachés</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Never
tell me secrets, but whenever any thing is publicly discussed in the clubs
and cafés, let me hear it.&rdquo; In the same way, he always rejected the
authenticity of any revelations where Talleyrand, or Metternich, or Pozzo
di Borgo&rsquo;s names appeared. &ldquo;These men,&rdquo; he always used to say, &ldquo;were their
own confidants, and never leaked save to serve a purpose.&rdquo; It was from Sir
Robert I heard a story first, which has since, I believe, been fully
corroborated. An Under-secretary of Talleyrand, during the Prince&rsquo;s
residence as French ambassador at St. James&rsquo;s, informed his Excellency one
morning, that a very tempting offer had been made to him if he would
disclose the contents of his master&rsquo;s writing-desk. He had not accepted,
nor altogether declined the proposal, wishing to know from the Prince how
it might be made available to his plans, and whether a direct accusation
of the author, a person of high station, would be deemed advisable.
Talleyrand merely said, &ldquo;Take the money; the middle board of the drawer in
my secretary is removable by a very simple contrivance, which I&rsquo;ll shew
you. I had it made so at Paris. You&rsquo;ll find all the papers you want there.
Take copies of them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But, Monsieur le Prince&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pray make your mind at ease. I&rsquo;ll neither compromise myself nor you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The Secretary obeyed; the bargain was perfected, and a supposed &ldquo;secret
correspondence between Talleyrand and Arnim,&rdquo; deposited in Lord T&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s
hands. About a week afterwards Lord T&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; invited the
Prince to pass some days at his seat in Herefordshire, where a
distinguished party was assembled. The Ambassador accepted; and they met
like the most cordial of friends. When the period of the visit drew to its
conclusion, they were walking one morning in the grounds together, engaged
in a conversation of the most amicable candour, each vying with the other
by the frankness and unreserve of his communications.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come now, Prince,&rdquo; said Lord T&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, &ldquo;we are, I rejoice
to find, on terms which will permit any freedom. Tell me frankly, how do
you stand with Prussia? Are there any understandings between you to which
we must not be parties?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;None whatever.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You say this freely and without reserve?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Without the slightest reserve or qualification.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Lord T&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; seemed overjoyed, and the discussion
concluded. They dined that day together, and in the evening a large
company was assembled to meet the Prince before his departure for London.
As usual at T&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; House, the party contained a great show
of distinguished persons, political and literary. Among the subjects of
conversation started was the question of how it happened that men of great
literary distinction so rarely could shine as statesmen; and that even
such as by their writings evinced a deep insight into political science,
were scarcely ever found to combine practical habits of business with this
great theoretical talent.
</p>
<p>
The discussion was amusing, because it was carried on by men who
themselves occupied the highest walks in their respective careers.
</p>
<p>
To arrest a somewhat warm turn of the controversy, Lord T&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
turning to the Prince, said, &ldquo;I suppose, Monsieur le Prince, you have
seldom been able to indulge in imaginative composition?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pardon me, my Lord, I have from time to time dissipated a little in that
respect; and, if I must confess it, with a very considerable degree of
amusement.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The announcement, made with a most perfect air of candour, interested at
once the whole company, who could not subdue their murmured expressions of
surprise as to the theme selected by the great Diplomatist.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; said he, smiling, &ldquo;I am in a position to gratify the present
company; for, if I mistake not, I have actually with me at this moment a
brief manuscript of my latest attempt in fiction. As I am a mere amateur,
without the slightest pretension to skill or ability, I feel no reluctance
at exposing my efforts to the kind criticism of friends. I only make one
stipulation.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, pray, what is it? any thing, of course, you desire!&rdquo; was heard on
every side.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is this. I read very badly, and I would request that T&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
our kind host, would take upon him to read it aloud for us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Lord T&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; was only too much flattered by the proposal,
and the Prince retired to fetch his papers, leaving the company amazed at
the singularity of a scene which so little accorded with all they had ever
heard of the deep and wily Minister; some of the shrewdest persons
significantly observing, that the Prince was evidently verging on those
years when vanity of every kind meets fewest obstacles to its display.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here are my papers, my Lord,&rdquo; said the Prince, entering with his
manuscript. &ldquo;I have only to hope that they may afford to the honourable
company any portion of the amusement their composition has given me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The party seated themselves round the room, and Lord T&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
disposing the papers on the table before him, arranged the candles, and
prepared to begin. &ldquo;The title of the piece is missing,&rdquo; said he, after a
pause.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, no, my Lord; you&rsquo;ll find it on the envelope,&rdquo; replied Talleyrand.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, very true; here it is!&mdash;&lsquo;Secret Correspondence&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 Lord T&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; stopped&mdash;his hands trembled&mdash;the
blood left his face&mdash;and he leaned back in his chair almost fainting.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are not ill!&mdash;are you ill?&rdquo; broke from many voices together.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; not in the least,&rdquo; said he, endeavouring to smile; &ldquo;but the Prince
has been practising a bit of &lsquo;plaisanterie&rsquo; on me, which I own has
astounded me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you read it, my Lord; or shall I explain?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Monsieur le Prince,&rdquo; said Lord T&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, crushing the
papers into his pocket, &ldquo;I think you may be satisfied;&rdquo; and with this, to
the company, very mysterious excuse, his Lordship abruptly retired; while
Talleyrand almost immediately set out for London.
</p>
<p>
The nature of the mystification was not disclosed till long afterwards;
and it is but justice to both parties to say, not by Talleyrand, but by
Lord T&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; himself.
</p>
<p>
With what facility men, whose whole daily life is artifice, can be imposed
on, is a very remarkable feature in all these cases. The practice of
deceit would actually appear to obstruct clear-sightedness and dull the
ordinary exercise of common sense. Witness that poor Dutch ambassador
Fabricius, who, a few years ago, was imposed on at Paris by Bouffé, the
comedian, representing himself to be the first Secretary of the Minister
for Foreign Affairs, and offering, for a sum of money, to confide to him
the secret negotiations between M. Guizot and the Belgian Government!
Fabricius, deceived by the great resemblance of Bouffé to the person he
represented, agreed, and actually wrote to the King of Holland a
triumphant despatch, announcing his own diplomatic dexterity. Every post
saw a huge packet of letters to the King, containing various documents and
papers; some assuming to be in the handwriting of Guizot&mdash;some, of
Nothomb&mdash;some, of the Duke of Wellington&mdash;and two or three of
King Leopold himself. The task of undeceiving the unhappy dupe was taken
by his Majesty Louis Philippe, who having, at an evening reception at
Neuilly, exposed his attempted corruption, coolly turned his back and
refused to receive him.
</p>
<p>
Another dive into this chaotic mass of reminiscence! A letter from poor
Granthorpe, whose sad suicide remains the unexplained and unexplainable
mystery of all who knew him. A man whose mind was remarkable for its being
so deeply imbued with sentiments of religious truth&mdash;whose whole life
was, so to say, devotional&mdash;is found dead, the act being by his own
hand! No circumstance of domestic calamity, no pecuniary difficulty, not
even a passing derangement of health, to account for the terrible event.
Here is his note; we were but new acquaintances at the time, and it
begins,&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Dear Sir,

&ldquo;From the conversation we held together lately at Lord N&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s
table, I believe I shall not misinterpret your
sentiments by supposing that any new fact connected with
Waterloo will interest you strongly. I therefore enclose you
a memoir, drawn up a few evenings back at W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.   It was
begun by way of a regular refutation of Alison, whose views
are so manifestly incorrect; the idea of publication is,
however, abandoned, and I am at liberty merely to shew it to
such of my friends as take a more than common interest in
the transaction.

&ldquo;Truly yours,

&ldquo;S. Granthorpe.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
The memoir which accompanied this is curious for two reasons: first, from
its authenticity; and, secondly, from the fact that, being dictated from
beginning to end, it is as clear, as consecutive, as free from
unnecessary, and as full of all necessary detail, as if the events were of
a few days&rsquo; back, and that no recital of them had yet been given to the
world. Two or three anecdotes (new to me, at least) were interspersed here
and there, not for themselves, but as circumstantially evidencing facts of
some importance.
</p>
<p>
One, I remember, alluded to a Prussian statement by a Captain Hahnsfelder,
who stated that two British guns, placed on the height above La Haye
Sainte, were captured by the French as early as eleven o&rsquo;clock. The
passage in the memoir is this:&mdash;&ldquo;Untrue; these guns were in the field
at seven in the evening, in the same position which they stood at the
beginning of the battle. They are in advance of Adam&rsquo;s left, and were so
far unprotected that the artillerymen who served them had to retire after
each discharge. The Cuirassiers made several attempts to carry them off,
but as orders were given that, after each fire, one wheel should be taken
off each gun, the cavalry failed in their object. They tried to lasso
them, but this also failed, besides losing them some men.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Alison&rsquo;s strategy, for he went so far as to plan a campaign of his own, is
very ably exposed, and the necessity of posting troops in particular
districts clearly explained from circumstances peculiar to the localities,
such as stationing the cavalry at Enghein, where alone forage was
procurable. The controversy, if it can be so called, is worthless. They
whose opinions are alone valuable are exactly the persons who will not
speak on the subject.
</p>
<p>
A strange-looking letter is this from C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; enclosing the
proof of a paper I wrote on Irish Educational matters, very laconic and
editorial:&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Dear T.,

&ldquo;You are all wrong: as blue and yellow, when mixed, form
green, so will your Protestant and Papist League make
nothing but rampant infidelity. In any great State scheme of
education there must be one grand standard of obedience&mdash;the
Bible is the only one I&rsquo;ve heard of yet. Keep this one then
till you hear of better.

&ldquo;Yours,

&ldquo;H. C.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
Another of the same hand:&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; desires me to inclose you these two letters: one I
know is an introduction to Guizot; the other, I suppose, to
be &lsquo;Ein empfehlungs Brief&rsquo; to the &lsquo;Gräfin.&rsquo; Take care to say
as little as possible to the one, and to have, in Irish
parlance, as little as possible &lsquo;to say&rsquo; to the other. At
Paris you want no guidance; and at Vienna, the Abbé Discot
is your man. Coloredo is out of favour for the moment; but
he can afford to wait, and, waiting, to win. Be assiduous in
your visits at B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;y&rsquo;s; and when the Countess affects
ignorance, let us always hear from you.

&ldquo;Yours ever,

&ldquo;H. C.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
This is a very rose-coloured and rose-odoured document:&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Dear Mr. Templeton,

&ldquo;I have to make two thousand excuses;  one each for two
indiscretions,    I believed I had your box at the Opera for
last evening; and I also fancied&mdash;think of my absurdity!&mdash;
that the bouquet  of camélias left there was meant for me.
Pray forgive me; or, rather, ask the fair lady who came in
at the ballet to forgive me.    I never can think of the
incident without shame and self-reproach; <i>du reste</i>, it
has given me the opportunity of knowing that your taste in
beauty  equals   your judgment   in flowers.

&ldquo;Very much yours,

&ldquo;Helen Collyton.

&ldquo;Sir H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; bids me say, that he expects you on Wednesday.
We dine earlier, as the Admiral goes on board in the
evening.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
This was an absurd incident; and, trivially as it is touched on here, made
of that same Lady Collyton a very dangerous enemy to me.
</p>
<p>
This is not a specimen of calligraphy, certainly:&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;If you promise neither to talk of the Catholic Question,
the Kildare Place Society, nor the &lsquo;Glorious Revolution of
1688.&rsquo; P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; will have no objection to meet you at dinner.
Hammond, you&rsquo;ve heard, I suppose, has lost his election; he
polled more voters than there were freeholders registered on
the books: this was proving too much, and he must pay the
penalty.   Y&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; is in, and will remain if he can; but
there is a hitch in it&mdash;&lsquo;as the man who lent him his
qualification is in gaol at Bruges.&rsquo; Write and say if you
accept the conditions.

&ldquo;Yours,

&ldquo;Frederick Hamilton.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
There are some memorials of a very different kind&mdash;they are bound up
together; and well may they, they form an episode quite apart from all the
events before or after them! I dare not open them; for, although years
have passed away, the wounds would bleed afresh if only breathed on! This
was the last I ever received from her. I have no need to open it&mdash;I
know every line by heart!&mdash;almost prophetic, too!
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;I have no fear of offending you now, since we shall never
meet again. The very thought that the whole world divides
us, as completely as death itself, will make you accept my
words less as reproof than warning. Once more, then, abandon
the career for which you have not health, nor energy, nor
enduring strength. Brilliant displays, discursive efforts,
however effective, will no more constitute statesmanship
than fireworks suffice to light up the streets of a city.
Like all men of quick intelligence, you undervalue those who
advance more slowly, forgetting that their gleaning is more
cleanly made, and that, while you come sooner, they come
more heavily laden. Again, this waiting for conviction&mdash;this
habit of listening to the arguments on each side, however
excellent in general life, is inapplicable in politics. You
must have opinions previously formed&mdash;you must have your
mind made up, on principles very different and much wider
than those a debate embraces. If I find the person who
guides me through the streets of a strange city stop to
inquire here, to ask this, to investigate that, and so on, I
at once conceive&mdash;and very reasonably&mdash;a doubt of his skill
and intelligence; but if he advance with a certain air of
assured knowledge, I yield myself to his guidance with
implicit trust: nor does it matter so much, when we have
reached the desired goal, that we made a slight divergence
from the shortest road.

&ldquo;Now, if a constituency concede much to your judgment,
remember that you owe a similar debt to the leader of your
party, who certainly&mdash;all consideration of ability apart&mdash;
sees further, because from a higher eminence, than other
men.

&ldquo;Again, you take no pleasure in any pursuit wherein no
obstacle presents itself; and yet, if the difficulty be one
involving a really strong effort, you abandon it. You
require as many conditions to your liking as did the
commander at Walcheren&mdash;the wind must not only blow from a
particular quarter, but with a certain degree of violence.
This will never do! The favouring gale that leads to
fortune is as often a hurricane as a zephyr; some are blown
into the haven half shipwrecked, but still safe.

&ldquo;Lastly, you have a failing, for which neither ability, nor
address, nor labour, nor even good luck, can compensate. You
trust every one&mdash;not from any implicit reliance on the
goodness of human nature&mdash;not that you think well of this
man, or highly of that, but simply from indolence.
‘Believing,&rsquo; is so very easy&mdash;such a rare self-indulgence!
Think of all the deception this has cost you&mdash;think of the
fallacies, which you knew to be fallacies, that found their
way into your head, tainting your own opinions, and mingling
themselves with your matured convictions. Believe me, there
is nothing but a strict quarantine can prevail against
error!&rdquo;

Enough of these,&mdash;now for an incremation: would that, Hindoo
like, I could consume with them the memory to which they
have been wedded!
</pre>
<hr />
<p>
Dr. H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; has been here again; he came in just as the
last flicker was expiring over the charred leaves; he guessed readily what
had been my occupation, and seemed to feel relieved that the sad office of
telling bad tidings of my case was taken off his hands. Symptoms seem now
crowding on each other&mdash;they come, like detached battalions meeting
on the field of battle when victory is won, only to shew themselves and to
proclaim how hopeless would be resistance. The course of the malady would,
latterly, appear to have been rapid, and yet how reluctant does the spirit
seem to quit its ruined temple!
</p>
<p>
I wish that I had more command over my faculties; the tricks Imagination
plays me at each moment are very painful: scarcely have I composed my mind
into a calm and patient frame, than Fancy sets to work at some vision of
returning health and strength&mdash;of home scenes and familiar faces&mdash;of
the green lanes of Old England, as seen at sunset of a summer eve, when
the last song of the blackbird rings through the clear air, and odours of
sweet flowers grow stronger in the heavy atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
To start from these, and think of what I am&mdash;of what so soon I shall
be!
</p>
<p>
What marvellously fine aspirations and noble enterprises cross the sick
man&rsquo;s fancy! The climate of health is sadly unfavourable to the creatures
begot of fancy&mdash;one tithe of the strange notions that are now warring
in my distracted brain would make matter for a whole novelist&rsquo;s library.
Thoughts that are thus engendered are like the wines which the Germans
call &ldquo;Ausgelesene,&rdquo; and which, falling from the grape unpressed, have none
of the impurities of fabrication about them. After all, the things that
have been left undone by all of us in this life, would be far better and
greater than those we have done.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Oh, the fond hearts that have never been smitten,
And all the hot tears that have never been shed!
Not to speak of the books that have never been written;
And all the smart things that have never been said!
</pre>
<hr />
<p>
Weaker and weaker!&mdash;the senses fail to retain impressions, and, like
cracked vases, let their contents ooze out by slow degrees. Objects of
sight become commingled with those of sound; and I can half understand the
blind man Locke tells us of, who imagined &ldquo;the colour scarlet to be like
the sound of a trumpet.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mesmerism affects the power of transferring the operations of one sense to
the organs of another; can it be that, in certain states of the brain, the
nervous fluids become intermixed?
</p>
<p>
It is night&mdash;calm, still, and starlit! How large are the stars
compared with what they appear in northern latitudes! And the moonlight,
too, is pale as silver, and has none of the yellow tint we see with us.
Beautifully it lies along that slope of the mountain yonder, where the
tall dark yew-trees throw their straight shadows across the glittering
surface.
</p>
<p>
It is the churchyard of St. M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;; and now in the church
I can perceive the twinkle of lights&mdash;they are the candles around the
coffin of him whose funeral I saw this morning. The custom of leaving the
body for a day in the church before consigning it to the grave is a
touching one. The dimly-lighted aisles, and the solemn air of the place,
seem a fitting transition from Life to the sleep of Death.
</p>
<p>
I have been thinking of that very old man, who came past the window
yesterday, and sat down to rest himself on the stone-bench beside the
door. Giordano never took a finer head as a study: lofty and massive, with
the temples deeply indented; and such a beard, snow-white and waving! How
I longed for strength enough to have wandered forth and seated myself
beside him! A strange, mysterious feeling was on me&mdash;that I should
hear words of comfort from his lips! This impression grew out of his own
remarkable story. Yes, poor and humble as his dress, lowly as his present
condition may seem, he was a &ldquo;Captain of the Imperial Guard&rdquo;&mdash;a proud
title once! He was taken prisoner during the retreat from Moscow, and,
with hundreds more, sent away to eternal exile in Siberia! At that period
he was in all the pride of manhood, a true specimen of his class&mdash;gay,
witty, full of daring, and a sceptic; a Frenchman of the Revolution
grafted on a gentleman of the old <i>régime!</i> The Fatalism that
sustained them&mdash;it was their only faith&mdash;through long years of
banishment, brought many in sadness to the grave! It was a
gloomy-religion, whose hope was but chastened despair! He himself lived
on, the reckless spirit of a bold heart hardening him against grief as
effectually as it excluded memory. When, at length, as time went on, and
his companions dropped off around him, a severe and cheerless melancholy
settled down upon him, and he lived on in a state of dreamy unreality,
less like sleep than death itself! And yet, through this dense cloud a ray
of light pierced and fell upon his cold and darkened spirit, like day
descending into some cleft between the mountains!
</p>
<p>
He was sitting at the door of his hut one evening, to taste the few short
moments of sunset, when, unwrapping the piece of paper which surrounded
his cigar&mdash;the one sole luxury the prisoners are permitted&mdash;he
was proceeding to light it, when a thought occurred that he would read the
lines, for it was a printed paper. He opened the bit of torn and ragged
paper, and found there three verses from the Gospel of St. John. Doubtless
he had often sat in weariness before the most heart-stirring appeals and
earnest exhortations; and yet these few lines did what years of such
teaching failed to do. The long-thirsting heart was refreshed by this one
drop of clear water! He became a believer, firm and faithful! His
liberation, which he owed to the clemency of the Emperor Alexander, set
him free to wander over the world as a missionary, and this he has been
ever since. How striking are his calm and benevolent features among the
faces which pass you in every street&mdash;for we live in times of eager
and insensate passion. The volcano has thrown forth ashes, and who knows
how soon the flame may follow!
</p>
<p>
How long this night appears! I have sat, as I believe, for hours here, and
yet it is but two o&rsquo;clock! The dreary vacuity of weakness is like a wide
and pathless waste. I see but one great spreading moorland, with a low,
dark horizon; no creature moves across the surface&mdash;no light glimmers
on it. It is the plain before the Valley of the Shadow of Death.
</p>
<p>
Poor Gilbert!&mdash;how soundly he sleeps, believing that I am also sunk
to rest! The deep-drawn breathings of his strong chest are strange beside
the fluttering hurry of my respiration. He was wearied out with watching&mdash;wearied,
as I feel myself: but Death comes not the sooner for our weariness; we
must bide our time, even like the felon whose sentence has fixed the day
and the hour.
</p>
<p>
Three o&rsquo;clock! What a chill is on me! The fire no longer warms me, nor
does the great cloak with which I braved the snows of Canada. This is a
sensation quite distinct from mere cold&mdash;it is like as though my body
were itself the source from which the air became chilled. I have tried to
heap more wood upon the fire, but am too weak to reach it. I cannot bear
to awaken that poor fellow. It is but enduring a little&mdash;a very
little longer&mdash;and all will be over!
</p>
<p>
There was a man upon the terrace below the window, walking slowly back and
forwards. What can it mean, so late? It has made me nervous and irritable
to watch his shadow as it crosses before me. There!&mdash;how strange!&mdash;he
has beckoned to me! Is this real? Now I see no one! Some trick of
imagination; but how weak it has left me! My hand trembles, too, with a
strange fear.
</p>
<p>
It has struck again! It must be four; and I have slept. What a long night
it has been! O Life! Life! how little your best and highest ambitions seem
to him who sits, like me, waiting to be released! Now and then the heart
beats full and strong, and a momentary sense of vigour flashes across my
mind; and then the icy current comes back, the faint straggle to breathe
shaking the frame as a wrecked vessel trembles with each crashing wave!
</p>
<p>
Day breaks at length&mdash;that must be the dawn! But my eyes are failing,
and my hands are numbed. Poor Gilbert! how sound is his sleep! He has
turned&mdash;and now he dreams! What is he muttering? Good night! good
night! Even so&mdash;good night!
</p>
<hr />
<p>
How cold&mdash;how very cold I feel! I thought it had been over! Oh, for a
little longer of this dalliance here!&mdash;ay, even here, on the last
shores of life! Inexpressibly sweet the odours are, and the birds! How I
drink in those strains!&mdash;they will float with me along the journey I
am going! Weaker and weaker. This must be death! Farewell!
</p>
<hr />
<p>
The circumstances which have placed these papers in my hands afford me the
only apology I can offer for making them public. They were bequeathed to
me, in some sort, as a recompense for services which my poor master had
long intended to have rewarded very differently; nor, save under the
pressure of an actual necessity, should I devote them now to the purpose
of personal assistance. I neither understand how to correct nor arrange
them. I have no skill in editorship, and send them to the printer without
the addition of a letter by any hand except his who wrote them. It is
true, some pages have been withheld&mdash;I am not sure whether
necessarily or not&mdash;for I have no competent judgment to guide me. I
would, however, hope, that what I here give to the world may, while
benefiting the servant, leave no stain upon the memory of the best of
masters.

A word may be necessary as to the political allusions, as they were all
written in the autumn of the past year, many are, of course, inapplicable
to countries whose condition the wonderful events lately occurring have
modified: many are, however, almost correct in every detail of prophetic
foresight; and, it is not necessary that I should repeat, have neither
been changed nor added to since penned by my late master.
